                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Depth estimation is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision, crucial for applications such as 3D reconstruction, free-viewpoint rendering, robotics, autonomous driving, and AR/VR technologies. Traditional methods relying on hardware sensors like LiDAR are often limited by high costs, low resolution, and environmental sensitivity, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. Recent advances in vision-based methods offer a promising alternative, yet they face challenges in generalization and stability due to either the low-capacity model architectures or the reliance on domain-specific and small-scale datasets. The emergence of scaling laws and foundation models in other domains has inspired the development of "depth foundation models": deep neural networks trained on large datasets with strong zero-shot generalization capabilities. This paper surveys the evolution of deep learning architectures and paradigms for depth estimation across the monocular, stereo, multi-view, and monocular video settings. We explore the potential of these models to address existing challenges and provide a comprehensive overview of large-scale datasets that can facilitate their development. By identifying key architectures and training strategies, we aim to highlight the path towards robust depth foundation models, offering insights into their future research and applications.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Perceiving and reconstructing 4D spatial-temporal geometry from videos is a fundamental yet challenging computer vision task. To facilitate interactive and real-time applications, we propose a streaming 4D visual geometry transformer that shares a similar philosophy with autoregressive large language models. We explore a simple and efficient design and employ a causal transformer architecture to process the input sequence in an online manner. We use temporal causal attention and cache the historical keys and values as implicit memory to enable efficient streaming long-term 4D reconstruction. This design can handle real-time 4D reconstruction by incrementally integrating historical information while maintaining high-quality spatial consistency. For efficient training, we propose to distill knowledge from the dense bidirectional visual geometry grounded transformer (VGGT) to our causal model. For inference, our model supports the migration of optimized efficient attention operator (e.g., FlashAttention) from the field of large language models. Extensive experiments on various 4D geometry perception benchmarks demonstrate that our model increases the inference speed in online scenarios while maintaining competitive performance, paving the way for scalable and interactive 4D vision systems.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Production-grade LLM systems require robust adherence to dozens or even hundreds of instructions simultaneously. However, the instruction-following capabilities of LLMs at high instruction densities have not yet been characterized, as existing benchmarks only evaluate models on tasks with a single or few instructions. We introduce IFScale, a simple benchmark of 500 keyword-inclusion instructions for a business report writing task to measure how instruction-following performance degrades as instruction density increases. We evaluate 20 state-of-the-art models across seven major providers and find that even the best frontier models only achieve 68% accuracy at the max density of 500 instructions. Our analysis reveals model size and reasoning capability to correlate with 3 distinct performance degradation patterns, bias towards earlier instructions, and distinct categories of instruction-following errors. Our insights can help inform design of instruction-dense prompts in real-world applications and highlight important performance-latency tradeoffs. We open-source the benchmark and all results for further analysis at https://distylai.github.io/IFScale.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> We consider generalizations of open ASEP in the interval and half-space, where the speed of the reservoir dynamics can depend on the local particle configuration. We show that their height functions have a continuum limit given by the open KPZ equation. This removes the assumption of Liggett's condition in Corwin-Shen '18 and Parekh '19, thus answering a question of Corwin, and it also removes the assumption of product invariant measures in Goncalves-Perkowski-Simon '20.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Standard Bayesian approaches for linear time-invariant (LTI) system identification are hindered by parameter non-identifiability; the resulting complex, multi-modal posteriors make inference inefficient and impractical. We solve this problem by embedding canonical forms of LTI systems within the Bayesian framework. We rigorously establish that inference in these minimal parameterizations fully captures all invariant system dynamics (e.g., transfer functions, eigenvalues, predictive distributions of system outputs) while resolving identifiability. This approach unlocks the use of meaningful, structure-aware priors (e.g., enforcing stability via eigenvalues) and ensures conditions for a Bernstein--von Mises theorem -- a link between Bayesian and frequentist large-sample asymptotics that is broken in standard forms. Extensive simulations with modern MCMC methods highlight advantages over standard parameterizations: canonical forms achieve higher computational efficiency, generate interpretable and well-behaved posteriors, and provide robust uncertainty estimates, particularly from limited data.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> In this study, we report that quantum quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check codes decoded via joint belief propagation (BP) exhibit steep error-rate curves, despite the presence of error floors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first observation of such threshold-like behavior for quantum codes with non-vanishing coding rate, excluding those decoded with non-binary BP decoders. Moreover, we find that dominant error events contributing to the error floor typically involve only a small number of bits. These findings suggest that the error floor is caused by trapping sets -- specific subgraph structures in the Tanner graph -- and indicate that identifying and avoiding such structures may lead to further reduction of the error floor.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> In text-to-image generation, producing a series of consistent contents that preserve the same identity is highly valuable for real-world applications. Although a few works have explored training-free methods to enhance the consistency of generated subjects, we observe that they suffer from the following problems. First, they fail to maintain consistent background details, which limits their applicability. Furthermore, when the foreground character undergoes large motion variations, inconsistencies in identity and clothing details become evident. To address these problems, we propose CharaConsist, which employs point-tracking attention and adaptive token merge along with decoupled control of the foreground and background. CharaConsist enables fine-grained consistency for both foreground and background, supporting the generation of one character in continuous shots within a fixed scene or in discrete shots across different scenes. Moreover, CharaConsist is the first consistent generation method tailored for text-to-image DiT model. Its ability to maintain fine-grained consistency, combined with the larger capacity of latest base model, enables it to produce high-quality visual outputs, broadening its applicability to a wider range of real-world scenarios.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> In many theories, matter-antimatter asymmetries originate from out-of-equilibrium decays and scatterings of heavy particles. While decays remain efficient, scattering rates typically drop below the Hubble rate as the universe expands. We point out the possibility of scatterings between non-relativistic particles and the relativistic bath whose cross-sections grow with decreasing temperature, leading to scattering rates that track or exceed the Hubble rate at late times. This results in soaring asymmetry generation, even at low scales and with small CP- or baryon/lepton-violating couplings.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Neural populations exhibit latent dynamical structures that drive time-evolving spiking activities, motivating the search for models that capture both intrinsic network dynamics and external unobserved influences. In this work, we introduce LangevinFlow, a sequential Variational Auto-Encoder where the time evolution of latent variables is governed by the underdamped Langevin equation. Our approach incorporates physical priors -- such as inertia, damping, a learned potential function, and stochastic forces -- to represent both autonomous and non-autonomous processes in neural systems. Crucially, the potential function is parameterized as a network of locally coupled oscillators, biasing the model toward oscillatory and flow-like behaviors observed in biological neural populations. Our model features a recurrent encoder, a one-layer Transformer decoder, and Langevin dynamics in the latent space. Empirically, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on synthetic neural populations generated by a Lorenz attractor, closely matching ground-truth firing rates. On the Neural Latents Benchmark (NLB), the model achieves superior held-out neuron likelihoods (bits per spike) and forward prediction accuracy across four challenging datasets. It also matches or surpasses alternative methods in decoding behavioral metrics such as hand velocity. Overall, this work introduces a flexible, physics-inspired, high-performing framework for modeling complex neural population dynamics and their unobserved influences.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> We present direct measurements of the intrinsic alignments (IA) of over 2 million spectroscopic galaxies using DESI Data Release 1 and imaging from four lensing surveys: DES, HSC, KiDS, and SDSS. In this uniquely data-rich regime, we take initial steps towards a more tailored IA modelling approach by building a library of IA measurements across colour, luminosity, stellar mass, and redshift. We map the dependence between galaxy type -- in terms of rest-frame colour, strength of the 4000 Angstrom break, and specific star formation rate -- and IA amplitude; the bluest galaxies have an alignment consistent with zero, across low (0.05<z<0.5) and high (0.8<z<1.55) redshifts. In order to construct cosmic shear samples that are minimally impacted by IA but maintain maximum sample size and statistical power, we map the dependence of alignment with colour purity. Red, quenched galaxies are strongly aligned and the amplitude of the signal increases with luminosity, which is tightly correlated with stellar mass in our catalogues. For DESI galaxies between 0<z<1.5, trends in luminosity and colour alone are sufficient to explain the alignments we measure -- with no need for an explicit redshift dependence. In a companion paper (Jeffrey et al., in prep), we perform detailed modelling of the IA signals with significant detections, including model comparison. Finally, to direct efforts for future IA measurements, we juxtapose the colour-magnitude-redshift coverage of existing IA measurements against modern and future lensing surveys.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> In the present work we study the nucleation of Dispersive shock waves (DSW) in the {defocusing}, discrete nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation (DNLS), a model of wide relevance to nonlinear optics and atomic condensates. Here, we study the dynamics of so-called dam break problems with step-initial data characterized by two-parameters, one of which corresponds to the lattice spacing, while the other being the right hydrodynamic background. Our analysis bridges the anti-continuum limit of vanishing coupling strength with the well-established continuum integrable one. To shed light on the transition between the extreme limits, we theoretically deploy Whitham modulation theory, various quasi-continuum asymptotic reductions of the DNLS and existence and stability analysis and connect our findings with systematic numerical computations. Our work unveils a sharp threshold in the discretization across which qualitatively continuum dynamics from the dam breaks are observed. Furthermore, we observe a rich multitude of wave patterns in the small coupling limit including unsteady (and stationary) Whitham shocks, traveling DSWs, discrete NLS kinks and dark solitary waves, among others. Besides, we uncover the phenomena of DSW breakdown and the subsequent formation of multi-phase wavetrains, due to generalized modulational instability of \textit{two-phase} wavetrains. We envision this work as a starting point towards a deeper dive into the apparently rich DSW phenomenology in a wide class of DNLS models across different dimensions and for different nonlinearities.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The development of scientific data analyses is a resource-intensive process that often yields results with untapped potential for reuse and reinterpretation. In many cases, a developed analysis can be used to measure more than it was designed for, by changing its input data or parametrization. Existing reinterpretation frameworks, such as RECAST, enable analysis reinterpretation by preserving the analysis implementation to allow for changes of particular parts of the input data. We introduce FlexCAST, which generalizes this concept by preserving the analysis design itself, supporting changes to the entire input data and analysis parametrization. FlexCAST is based on three core principles: modularity, validity, and robustness. Modularity enables a change of the input data and parametrization, while validity ensures that the obtained results remain meaningful, and robustness ensures that as many configurations as possible yield meaningful results. While not being limited to data-driven machine learning techniques, FlexCAST is particularly valuable for the reinterpretation of analyses in this context, where changes in the input data can significantly impact the parametrization of the analysis. Using a state-of-the-art anomaly detection analysis on LHC-like data, we showcase FlexCAST's core principles and demonstrate how it can expand the reach of scientific data analysis through flexible reuse and reinterpretation.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential for solving real-world problems and promise to be a solution for tasks automation in industry. However, more benchmarks are needed to systematically evaluate automation agents from an industrial perspective, for example, in Civil Engineering. Therefore, we propose DrafterBench for the comprehensive evaluation of LLM agents in the context of technical drawing revision, a representation task in civil engineering.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> We carry out a detailed analytical investigation of the propagation of gravitational waves in bimetric gravity in a late-time de Sitter epoch. In this regime, the dynamical equations for the massless and massive graviton modes can be decoupled and solved exactly. We provide uniform approximations for the modes in terms of elementary functions, which are valid on all scales and for all viable mass windows. We identify different dynamical regimes for the system, depending on the propagation properties of the massive graviton, and whether the massless and massive components of the signal can be temporally resolved or not. In each regime, we compute the gravitational-wave luminosity distance as a function of redshift and study the propagation of wave packets. Further, by an explicit computation, we show that the massless and massive components of the signal retain their coherence also in the regime where they can be temporally resolved, even when couplings to incoherent matter degrees of freedom are included.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Ambiguity in natural language instructions poses significant risks in safety-critical human-robot interaction, particularly in domains such as surgery. To address this, we propose a framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) for ambiguity detection specifically designed for collaborative surgical scenarios. Our method employs an ensemble of LLM evaluators, each configured with distinct prompting techniques to identify linguistic, contextual, procedural, and critical ambiguities. A chain-of-thought evaluator is included to systematically analyze instruction structure for potential issues. Individual evaluator assessments are synthesized through conformal prediction, which yields non-conformity scores based on comparison to a labeled calibration dataset. Evaluating Llama 3.2 11B and Gemma 3 12B, we observed classification accuracy exceeding 60% in differentiating ambiguous from unambiguous surgical instructions. Our approach improves the safety and reliability of human-robot collaboration in surgery by offering a mechanism to identify potentially ambiguous instructions before robot action.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> This study explores the field of modified inertia through a novel model involving maximal and minimal acceleration bounds. A principle of dynamics is developed within special relativity and has direct implications in astrophysics, especially for galaxy rotation curves. The presence of a minimal acceleration significantly reduces the amount of dark matter required to account for these curves. The model presented here is however conceptually different from fiduciary Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). The modified inertia with the minimal acceleration bound closely matches with many observed galaxy rotation curves and the radial acceleration relation, showing a better agreement than MOND in the $10^{-10}$ m s$^{-2}$ regime. Additionally, the minimal acceleration is predicted to evolve with redshift.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Remote sensing change detection is vital for monitoring environmental and urban transformations but faces challenges like manual feature extraction and sensitivity to noise. Traditional methods and early deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), struggle to capture long-range dependencies and global context essential for accurate change detection in complex scenes. While Transformer-based models mitigate these issues, their computational complexity limits their applicability in high-resolution remote sensing. Building upon ChangeMamba architecture, which leverages state space models for efficient global context modeling, this paper proposes precision fusion blocks to capture channel-wise temporal variations and per-pixel differences for fine-grained change detection. An enhanced decoder pipeline, incorporating lightweight channel reduction mechanisms, preserves local details with minimal computational cost. Additionally, an optimized loss function combining Cross Entropy, Dice and Lovasz objectives addresses class imbalance and boosts Intersection-over-Union (IoU). Evaluations on SYSU-CD, LEVIR-CD+, and WHU-CD datasets demonstrate superior precision, recall, F1 score, IoU, and overall accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the approach's robustness for remote sensing change detection.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have shown promise in various applications, such as motor imagery and cognitive state monitoring. However, decoding visual representations from EEG signals remains a significant challenge due to their complex and noisy nature. We thus propose a novel 5-stage framework for decoding visual representations from EEG signals: (1) an EEG encoder for concept classification, (2) cross-modal alignment of EEG and text embeddings in CLIP feature space, (3) caption refinement via re-ranking, (4) weighted interpolation of concept and caption embeddings for richer semantics, and (5) image generation using a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model. We enable context-aware EEG-to-image generation through cross-modal alignment and re-ranking. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates high-quality images aligned with visual stimuli, outperforming SOTA approaches by 13.43% in Classification Accuracy, 15.21% in Generation Accuracy and reducing Fr\'echet Inception Distance by 36.61%, indicating superior semantic alignment and image quality.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Opinion dynamics, the study of how individual beliefs and collective public opinion evolve, is a fertile domain for applying statistical physics to complex social phenomena. Like physical systems, societies exhibit macroscopic regularities from localized interactions, leading to outcomes such as consensus or fragmentation. This field has grown significantly, attracting interdisciplinary methods and driven by a surge in large-scale behavioral data. This review covers its rapid progress, bridging the literature dispersion. We begin with essential concepts and definitions, encompassing the nature of opinions, microscopic and macroscopic dynamics. This foundation leads to an overview of empirical research, from lab experiments to large-scale data analysis, which informs and validates models of opinion dynamics. We then present individual-based models, categorized by their macroscopic phenomena (e.g., consensus, polarization, echo chambers) and microscopic mechanisms (e.g., homophily, assimilation). We also review social contagion phenomena, highlighting their connection to opinion dynamics. Furthermore, the review covers common analytical and computational tools, including stochastic processes, treatments, simulations, and optimization. Finally, we explore emerging frontiers, such as connecting empirical data to models and using AI agents as testbeds for novel social phenomena. By systematizing terminology and emphasizing analogies with traditional physics, this review aims to consolidate knowledge, provide a robust theoretical foundation, and shape future research in opinion dynamics.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Many empirical systems contain complex interactions of arbitrary size, representing, for example, chemical reactions, social groups, co-authorship relationships, and ecological dependencies. These interactions are known as higher-order interactions and the collection of these interactions comprise a higher-order network, or hypergraph. Hypergraphs have established themselves as a popular and versatile mathematical representation of such systems and a number of software packages written in various programming languages have been designed to analyze these networks. However, the ecosystem of higher-order network analysis software is fragmented due to specialization of each software's programming interface and compatible data representations. To enable seamless data exchange between higher-order network analysis software packages, we introduce the Hypergraph Interchange Format (HIF), a standardized format for storing higher-order network data. HIF supports multiple types of higher-order networks, including undirected hypergraphs, directed hypergraphs, and simplicial complexes, while actively exploring extensions to represent multiplex hypergraphs, temporal hypergraphs, and ordered hypergraphs. To accommodate the wide variety of metadata used in different contexts, HIF also includes support for attributes associated with nodes, edges, and incidences. This initiative is a collaborative effort involving authors, maintainers, and contributors from prominent hypergraph software packages. This project introduces a JSON schema with corresponding documentation and unit tests, example HIF-compliant datasets, and tutorials demonstrating the use of HIF with several popular higher-order network analysis software packages.</p>

Recent implementations of machine learning (ML) algorithms demonstrate the optimization of complex cold atom ex perimental sequences in a multi-dimensional parameter space. Here, we report on the use of ML to optimize loading of cold atoms into a hollow-core fiber. We use Gaussian process machine learning in M-LOOP, an open-source online machine learning interface, to perform this optimization. This is implemented by iteratively adjusting experimental parameters based on feedback from an atom-counting measurement of optical "bleaching". We test the effectiveness of ML, alongside a manual scan, to converge to optimal loading conditions. We survey multiple ML runs to auto matically access appreciable atom-loading conditions. In conjunction with experimental design choices, ML-assisted optimization holds promise in the implementation and maintenance of complex cold atom experiments.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Cosmic Distance Duality Relation (CDDR) connects the angular diameter distance ($d_A$) and the luminosity distance ($d_L$) at a given redshift. This fundamental relation holds in any metric theory of gravity, provided that photon number is conserved and light propagates along null geodesics. A deviation from this relation could indicate new physics beyond the standard cosmological model. In this work, we test the validity of the CDDR at very low redshifts ($z < 0.04$) by combining $d_A$ from the Megamaser Cosmology Project with $d_L$ from the Pantheon+ sample of Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa). We find the relation to be statistically consistent with the current data. We further incorporate high-redshift Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO)-based $d_A$ measurements from DESI DR2 in combination with SNIa data, highlighting the critical role of the $r_d-M_b$ (early-late) calibration in testing the CDDR using these two probes. Assuming CDDR holds, we perform a Bayesian analysis to derive model-independent constraints on the calibration parameters. Using only BAO and SNIa data, we observe a strong degeneracy between $r_d$ and $M_b$. However, the inclusion of calibration-free Megamaser measurements breaks this degeneracy, enabling independent constraints without relying on a specific cosmological model or distance-ladder techniques. Additionally, we present a forecast incorporating the expected precision from future Megamaser and SNIa observations, demonstrating their potential to significantly tighten constraints on early-late calibration parameters, under the assumption of validity of CDDR.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Operating Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is increasingly challenged by limited communication bandwidth and strained computational and memory costs. Thus, cloud-assisted remote fine-tuning becomes indispensable. Nevertheless, existing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) approaches typically employ fixed or heuristic rank configurations, and the subsequent over-the-air transmission of all LoRA parameters could be rather inefficient. To address this limitation, we develop AirLLM, a hierarchical diffusion policy framework for communication-aware LoRA adaptation. Specifically, AirLLM models the rank configuration as a structured action vector that spans all LoRA-inserted projections. To solve the underlying high-dimensional sequential decision-making problem, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent generates coarse-grained decisions by jointly observing wireless states and linguistic complexity, which are then refined via Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) to produce high-resolution, task- and channel-adaptive rank vectors. The two modules are optimized alternatively, with the DDIM trained under the Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) paradigm to maintain alignment with PPO rewards. Experiments under varying signal-to-noise ratios demonstrate that AirLLM consistently enhances fine-tuning performance while significantly reducing transmission costs, highlighting the effectiveness of reinforcement-driven, diffusion-refined rank adaptation for scalable and efficient remote fine-tuning over the air.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Let $K$ be a field of characteristic zero over which every diagonal form in sufficiently many variables admits a nontrivial solution. For example, $K$ may be a totally imaginary number field or a finite extension of a $p$-adic field. Suppose $f_1,\ldots,f_s$ are forms of degree $d$ over $K.$ Bik, Draisma and Snowden recently proved that there exists a constant $B = B(d,s,K)$ such that the rational solutions to the system of equations $f_1=\ldots=f_s = 0$ are Zariski dense, as long as the Birch rank of $f_1,\ldots,f_s$ is greater than $B.$ We establish an effective bound for this constant. Combined with results of Skinner, we obtain as a corollary a sufficient condition for the integer zeros of a system of forms over a number field to satisfy the Hardy-Littlewood asymptotic with a positive leading term. This corollary generalizes a seminal result proved by Schmidt for the rational numbers.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Two OFFO (Objective-Function Free Optimization) noise tolerant algorithms are presented that handle bound constraints, inexact gradients and use second-order information when available.The first is a multi-level method exploiting a hierarchical description of the problem and the second is a domain-decomposition method covering the standard addditive Schwarz decompositions. Both are generalizations of the first-order AdaGrad algorithm for unconstrained optimization. Because these algorithms share a common theoretical framework, a single convergence/complexity theory is provided which covers them both. Its main result is that, with high probability, both methods need at most $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations and noisy gradient evaluations to compute an $\epsilon$-approximate first-order critical point of the bound-constrained problem. Extensive numerical experiments are discussed on applications ranging from PDE-based problems to deep neural network training, illustrating their remarkable computational efficiency.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Mixed-precision algorithms have been proposed as a way for scientific computing to benefit from some of the gains seen for artificial intelligence (AI) on recent high performance computing (HPC) platforms. A few applications dominated by dense matrix operations have seen substantial speedups by utilizing low precision formats such as FP16. However, a majority of scientific simulation applications are memory bandwidth limited. Beyond preliminary studies, the practical gain from using mixed-precision algorithms on a given HPC system is largely unclear. The High Performance GMRES Mixed Precision (HPG-MxP) benchmark has been proposed to measure the useful performance of a HPC system on sparse matrix-based mixed-precision applications. In this work, we present a highly optimized implementation of the HPG-MxP benchmark for an exascale system and describe our algorithm enhancements. We show for the first time a speedup of 1.6x using a combination of double- and single-precision on modern GPU-based supercomputers.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Virtual imaging trials (VITs) offer scalable and cost-effective tools for evaluating imaging systems and protocols. However, their translational impact depends on rigorous comparability between virtual and real-world populations. This study introduces DISTINCT (Distributional Subsampling for Covariate-Targeted Alignment), a statistical framework for selecting demographically aligned subsamples from large clinical datasets to support robust comparisons with virtual cohorts. We applied DISTINCT to the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) and a companion virtual trial dataset (VLST). The algorithm jointly aligned typical continuous (age, BMI) and categorical (sex, race, ethnicity) variables by constructing multidimensional bins based on discretized covariates. For a given target size, DISTINCT samples individuals to match the joint demographic distribution of the reference population. We evaluated the demographic similarity between VLST and progressively larger NLST subsamples using Wasserstein and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) distances to identify the maximal subsample size with acceptable alignment. The algorithm identified a maximal aligned NLST subsample of 9,974 participants, preserving demographic similarity to the VLST population. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis using risk scores for lung cancer detection showed that area under the curve (AUC) estimates stabilized beyond 6,000 participants, confirming the sufficiency of aligned subsamples for virtual imaging trial evaluation. Stratified AUC analysis revealed substantial performance variation across demographic subgroups, reinforcing the importance of covariate alignment in comparative studies.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> We study temperature and velocity fluctuations in turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard convection through direct numerical simulations in a three-dimensional plane layer of height $H$ with horizontal periodic boundary conditions and aspect ratio $4H\times 4H\times H$. The analysis is performed for Rayleigh numbers $10^5 \leq Ra \leq 10^{11}$ and Prandtl number $Pr=0.7$. First, the study systematically summarizes the height-dependent statistics of velocity and temperature fluctuations and reports corresponding scalings with the Rayleigh number. Secondly, we include an analysis on the role of coherent and incoherent flow regions near the wall for the global heat transfer. Thirdly, we investigate the dependence of turbulent heat and momentum transfer on additional finite-amplitude shear flow modes in the initial condition at time $t=0$, which either decay unforced with respect to time in a long transient or remain existent when a steady volume forcing in the momentum balance of the Boussinesq model is added. In the latter case, logarithmic near-wall layers for mean velocity and temperature are formed. In all cases, no impact on the global turbulent heat and momentum transfer within the error bars is detected, even though the shear mode amplitude is of the order of the characteristic free-fall velocity.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A major open question in algorithmic game theory is whether normal-form correlated equilibria (NFCE) can be computed efficiently in succinct games such as extensive-form games [DFF+25,6PR24,FP23,HvS08,VSF08,PR08]. Motivated by this question, we study the associated Threshold problem: deciding whether there exists a correlated equilibrium whose value exceeds a given threshold. We prove that this problem is PSPACE-hard for NFCE in multiplayer extensive-form games with perfect recall, even for fixed thresholds. To contextualize this result, we also establish the complexity of the Threshold problem for Nash equilibria in this setting, showing it is ER-complete. These results uncover a surprising complexity reversal: while optimal correlated equilibria are computationally simpler than optimal Nash in normal-form games, the opposite holds in extensive-form games, where computing optimal correlated equilibria is provably harder. Building on this line of inquiry, we also address a related question by [VSF08], who introduced the notions of extensive-form correlated equilibrium (EFCE) and agent-form correlated equilibrium (AFCE). They asked how difficult the Threshold problem is for AFCE; we answer this question by proving that it is NP-hard, even in two-player games without chance nodes. Complementing our hardness results, we establish tight complexity classifications for the Threshold problem across several correlated equilibrium concepts - including EFCE, AFCE, normal-form coarse, extensive-form coarse, and agent-form coarse correlated equilibria. For each of these solution concepts in multiplayer stochastic extensive-form games with perfect recall, we prove NP-completeness by providing matching NP upper bounds to the previously known hardness results. Together, our results provide the most complete landscape to date for the complexity of optimal equilibrium computation in extensive-form games.</p>

Through human evaluation campaigns involving categorical error assessment and span-level annotation, we compare traditional metrics, trainable methods, and LLM-as-a-judge approaches. Our findings reveal that simpler metrics like word overlap correlate surprisingly well with human judgments (Spearman correlation rank of 0.63), often outperforming more complex methods when applied to out-of-domain data. We further demonstrate that while LLMs can generate high-quality highlights, they prove unreliable for evaluation as they tend to severely under- or over-annotate. Our analysis of real-world business impacts shows incorrect and non-checkable information pose the greatest risks. We also highlight challenges in crowdsourced evaluations.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> KV cache accelerates LLM inference by avoiding redundant computation, at the expense of memory. To support larger KV caches, prior work extends GPU memory with CPU memory via CPU-offloading. This involves swapping KV cache between GPU and CPU memory. However, because the cache updates dynamically, such swapping incurs high CPU memory traffic. We make a key observation that model parameters remain constant during runtime, unlike the dynamically updated KV cache. Building on this, we introduce MIRAGE, which avoids KV cache swapping by remapping, and thereby repurposing, the memory allocated to model parameters for KV cache. This parameter remapping is especially beneficial in multi-tenant environments, where the memory used for the parameters of the inactive models can be more aggressively reclaimed. Exploiting the high CPU-GPU bandwidth offered by the modern hardware, such as the NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchip, we show that MIRAGE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, achieving a reduction of 44.8%-82.5% in tail time-between-token latency, 20.7%-99.3% in tail time-to-first-token latency, and 6.6%-86.7% higher throughput compared to vLLM.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> To meet the increasing demand of deep learning (DL) models, AI chips are employing both off-chip memory (e.g., HBM) and high-bandwidth low-latency interconnect for direct inter-core data exchange. However, it is not easy to explore the efficiency of these inter-core connected AI (ICCA) chips, due to a fundamental tussle among compute (per-core execution), communication (inter-core data exchange), and I/O (off-chip data access). In this paper, we develop Elk, a DL compiler framework to maximize the efficiency of ICCA chips by jointly trading off all the three performance factors discussed above. Elk structures these performance factors into configurable parameters and forms a global trade-off space in the DL compiler. To systematically explore this space and maximize overall efficiency, Elk employs a new inductive operator scheduling policy and a cost-aware on-chip memory allocation algorithm. It generates globally optimized execution plans that best overlap off-chip data loading and on-chip execution. To examine the efficiency of Elk, we build a full-fledged emulator based on a real ICCA chip IPU-POD4, and an ICCA chip simulator for sensitivity analysis with different interconnect network topologies. Elk achieves 94% of the ideal roofline performance of ICCA chips on average, showing the benefits of supporting large DL models on ICCA chips. We also show Elk's capability of enabling architecture design space exploration for new ICCA chip development.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> One of the major challenges in enterprise data analysis is the task of finding joinable tables that are conceptually related and provide meaningful insights. Traditionally, joinable tables have been discovered through a search for similar columns, where two columns are considered similar syntactically if there is a set overlap or they are considered similar semantically if either the column embeddings or value embeddings are closer in the embedding space. However, for enterprise data lakes, column similarity is not sufficient to identify joinable columns and tables. The context of the query column is important. Hence, in this work, we first define context-aware column joinability. Then we propose a multi-criteria approach, called TOPJoin, for joinable column search. We evaluate TOPJoin against existing join search baselines over one academic and one real-world join search benchmark. Through experiments, we find that TOPJoin performs better on both benchmarks than the baselines.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> We report the detection and characterization of TOI-201 c, a long-period transiting companion to the warm Jupiter TOI-201 b. Its presence was first inferred from high-amplitude transit timing variations (TTVs) in TOI-201 b, pointing to a massive outer body on a $7.7^{+1.0}_{-0.6}$-year eccentric orbit. This prediction was confirmed when TESS observed a transit of TOI-201 c, precisely constraining its orbital geometry. A joint fit to TTVs, transit photometry, and archival radial velocities yields a mass of $14.2^{+1.0}_{-1.2}$ $M_{\rm Jup}$ and an eccentricity of $0.643^{+0.009}_{-0.021}$. The mutual inclination between planets b and c is $2.9^{+4.8}_{-4.4}$ degrees, indicating a nearly coplanar architecture. Long-term numerical integrations confirm dynamical stability over gigayear timescales and predict that transits of TOI-201 b will cease within a few thousand years. TOI-201 c ranks among the longest-period transiting planets with well-constrained properties. Its detection via TTVs, followed by a confirmed transit, represents a rare observational sequence and highlights the power of TTVs and photometric monitoring to uncover distant companions. The TOI-201 system offers a valuable laboratory for testing models of giant planet formation, migration, and secular evolution in multi-planet systems.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Migration is central in various societal problems related to socioeconomic development. While much of the existing research has focused on international migration, migration patterns within a single country remain relatively unexplored. In this work we study internal migration patterns in Austria for a period of over 20 years, obtained from open and high-granularity administrative records. We employ inferential network methods to characterize the flows between municipalities and extract their clustering according to similar target and destination rates. Our methodology reveals significant deviations from commonly assumed relocation patterns modeled by the gravity law. At the same time, we observe unexpected biases of internal migrations that leads to less frequent movements across boundaries at both district and state levels than predictions suggest. This leads to significant regionalization of migration at multiple geographical scales and augmented division between urban and rural areas. These patterns appear to be remarkably persistent across decades of migration data, demonstrating systematic limitations of conventionally used gravity models in migration studies. Our approach presents a robust methodology that can be used to improve such evaluations, and can reveal new phenomena in migration networks.</p>

However, many fields continue to be severely limited by the typically low average power of these sources, which restricts speed, signal-to-noise ratio, and dynamic range in numerous measurements. Conversely, the past two decades have seen spectacular progress in high average power ultrafast laser technology based on Ytterbium lasers, rendering hundreds of watts to kilowatts of average power available to this community to drive THz sources. This has opened the young field of high-average-power laserdriven THz time-domain spectroscopy, which holds the potential to revolutionize the applications of THz time-domain systems. In this perspective article, we discuss this young field and emphasize recent advancements in broadband terahertz sources utilizing high-power Yb-based ultrafast lasers as drivers, which are nearing watt-level average power. We discuss various approaches explored thus far, current challenges, prospects for scaling, and future research areas that will accelerate their implementation in applications.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Humanoid robots have seen remarkable advances in dexterity, balance, and locomotion, yet their role in expressive domains, such as music performance, remains largely unexplored. Musical tasks, like drumming, present unique challenges, including split-second timing, rapid contacts, and multi-limb coordination over pieces lasting minutes. In this paper, we introduce Robot Drummer, a humanoid system capable of expressive, high-precision drumming across a diverse repertoire of songs. We formulate humanoid drumming as sequential fulfillment of timed-contacts and transform drum scores in to a Rhythmic Contact Chain. To handle the long-horizon nature of musical performance, we decompose each piece into fixed-length segments and train a single policy across all segments in parallel using reinforcement learning. Through extensive experiments on over thirty popular rock, metal, and jazz tracks, our results demonstrate that Robot Drummer consistently achieves high F1 scores. The learned behaviors exhibit emergent human-like drumming strategies, such as cross-arm strikes, and adaptive sticks assignments, demonstrating the potential of reinforcement learning to bring humanoid robots into the domain of creative musical performance.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Time delays in photoemission are on the order of attoseconds and have been experimentally determined in atoms, molecules and solids. Their magnitude and energy dependence are expected to yield fundamental insights into the properties of the systems in which they're measured. In a recent study Biswas \textsl{et al.} (Biswas, S., F\"org, B., Ortmann, L. et al. Probing molecular environment through photoemission delays. Nat. Phys. 16, 778-783 (2020)) determined the absolute photoemission time of the I$4d$ level in iodoethane via attosecond streaking spectroscopy, finding the presence of a functional group to increase the photoemission time delay, suggesting a correlation between the size of the functional group and time delay based on a semi-classical calculation. Here we experimentally study the dependence of the I$4d$ photoemission time on the functional group in the iodoalkanes from iodomethane up to 2-iodobutane at three photon energies across the giant resonance in the I$4d\to\varepsilon f$ photoemission channel, finding that the presence alone of a functional group does not necessarily increase the photoemission delay, and that overall no clear correlation between its size and the photoemission time delay can be established.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A classical theorem of Macbeath states that for any integers $d \geq 2$, $n \geq d+1$, $d$-dimensional Euclidean balls are hardest to approximate, in terms of volume difference, by inscribed convex polytopes with $n$ vertices. In this paper we investigate normed variants of this problem: we intend to find the extremal values of the Busemann volume, Holmes-Thompson volume, Gromov's mass and Gromov's mass$^*$ of a largest volume convex polytope with $n$ vertices, inscribed in the unit ball of a $d$-dimensional normed space.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> In this letter, we relate the factorization for $e^+e^- \to h_1 h_2 X$ to the factorization for energy-energy correlators in the collinear limit. This enables us to give a nonperturbative proof of factorization for the energy correlators, relate the energy correlator jet function to transverse-momentum-sensitive dihadron fragmentation functions, and provide a rigorous description of the confinement transition region.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The negatively charged boron vacancy $V_B^-$ defect in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has recently emerged as a promising spin qubit for sensing due to its high-temperature spin control and versatile integration into van der Waals structures. While extensive experiments have explored their coherence properties, much less is known about the spin relaxation time $T_1$ and its control-parameter dependence. In this work, we develop a parameter-free spin dynamics model based on the cluster-expansion technique to investigate $T_1$ relaxation mechanisms at low temperature. Our results reveal that the $V_B^-$ center constitutes a strongly coupled electron spin-nuclear spin core, which necessitates the inclusion of the coherent dynamics and derived memory effects of the three nearest-neighbor nitrogen nuclear spins. Using this framework, this work closely reproduces the experimentally observed $T_1$ time at $B = 90\,\mathrm{G}$ and further predicts the $T_1$ dependence on external magnetic field in the $0 \le B \le 2000\,\mathrm{G}$ interval, when the spin relaxation is predominantly driven by electron-nuclear and nuclear-nuclear flip-flop processes mediated by hyperfine and dipolar interactions. This study establishes a reliable and scalable approach for describing $T_1$ relaxation in $V_B^-$ centers and offers microscopic insights to support future developments in nuclear-spin-based quantum technologies.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> It has been established that a significant fraction of star formation at high-redshift occurs in clumpy galaxies. The properties of clumps and their formation mechanisms, however, remain highly debated. In this work we analyze a sample of 18 Supercompact Ultraviolet Luminous Galaxies observed with the OSIRIS spectrograph at the Keck Telescope, targeting their Pa-alpha emission. These galaxies, although at z~0.1-0.2, share many similar properties with star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon. We find a total of 84 star-forming clumps with typical sizes of a few hundred parsecs. The star-forming clumps exhibit low values of velocity shear (~12 km/s) and high velocity dispersion (~70 km/s). The dynamical masses of the clumps are typically higher than gas masses inferred from the measured star-formation rates of each clump. We also artificially redshift our data to emulate observations at z=2.2 and allow for a direct comparison with other galaxies at higher redshift. Our results indicate that, due to the effects of clump clustering and low-resolution observations, high-z clumps appear larger at greater cosmological distances. This underscores the importance of using low-redshift observations to anchor studies at earlier epochs. Finally, our results support the idea of growing clump sizes in star-forming galaxies as a function of redshift, although not to scales of kpc as found by other works without the benefits of adaptive optics or gravitational lensing.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> We present a numerical study on clapping propulsion using a body consisting of two rigid plates hinged at one end, with a 60-degree interplate cavity. The closing of the cavity generates a thrust-producing jet. Our previous experimental study (Mahulkar and Arakeri, PRF, 2024) compared the flow fields of the clapping body in two cases: free-moving (dynamic) and forward-constrained (stationary). The experiments revealed significant differences in body motion and flow structures. This numerical study further investigates these differences using plate motion data from the experiments. Our computations show that, in dynamic cases, interplate cavity pressure is lower than in stationary cases. A basic unsteady Bernoulli analysis explains that forward acceleration reduces interplate pressure. Furthermore, stationary cases exhibit distinct vortex dynamics, with starting vortex tubes forming at the plate edges and reconnecting with stopping vortex tubes to form triangular vortex loops in the rear wake, along with two sideways-oriented ringlets. In dynamic cases, the starting vortex tubes slide backward and reconnect with bound-vorticity threads shed from the outer surface of the plates, forming elliptical loops that reconnect circumferentially. Referring to Sullivan et al. (JFM, 2008), we quantify the energy deficit in isolated axisymmetric vortex rings using separate simulations and propose a model for the potential energy in the vortex core at the formation time. Using this model, we show that the total wake energy (kinetic + potential) equals the initial slug energy for the vortex ring, and in clapping, it equals the work done on the fluid by the pressure torque on the plates.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Recognizing how technical systems can embody social values or cause harms, human-computer interaction (HCI) research often approaches addressing values and ethics in design by creating tools to help tech workers integrate social values into the design of products. While useful, these approaches usually do not consider the politics embedded in the broader processes, organizations, social systems, and governance structures that affect the types of actions that tech workers can take to address values and ethics. This paper argues that creating infrastructures to support values and ethics work, rather than tools, is an approach that takes these broader processes into account and opens them up for (re)design. Drawing on prior research conceptualizing infrastructures from science \& technology studies and media studies, this paper outlines conceptual insights from infrastructures studies that open up new tactics for HCI researchers and designers seeking to support values and ethics in design.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces a novel approach for jointly solving the periodic Train Timetabling Problem (TTP), train routing, and Vehicle Circulation Problem (VCP) through a unified optimization model. While these planning stages are traditionally addressed sequentially, their interdependencies often lead to suboptimal vehicle usage. We propose the VCR-PESP, an integrated formulation that minimizes fleet size while ensuring feasible and infrastructure-compliant periodic timetables. We present the first Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)-based method for the VCR-PESP to solve the resulting large-scale instances. Unlike the Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT), which requires time discretisation, SMT supports continuous time via difference constraints, eliminating the trade-off between temporal precision and encoding size. Our approach avoids rounding artifacts and scales effectively, outperforming both SAT and Mixed Integer Program (MIP) models across non-trivial instances. Using real-world data from the Swiss narrow-gauge operator RhB, we conduct extensive experiments to assess the impact of time discretisation, vehicle circulation strategies, route flexibility, and planning integration. We show that discrete models inflate vehicle requirements and that fully integrated solutions substantially reduce fleet needs compared to sequential approaches. Our framework consistently delivers high-resolution solutions with tractable runtimes, even in large and complex networks. By combining modeling accuracy with scalable solver technology, this work establishes SMT as a powerful tool for integrated railway planning. It demonstrates how relaxing discretisation and solving across planning layers enables more efficient and implementable timetables.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Colors are omnipresent in today's world and play a vital role in how humans perceive and interact with their surroundings. However, it is challenging for computers to imitate human color perception. This paper introduces the Human Perception-Based Fuzzy Color Model, COLIBRI (Color Linguistic-Based Representation and Interpretation), designed to bridge the gap between computational color representations and human visual perception. The proposed model uses fuzzy sets and logic to create a framework for color categorization. Using a three-phase experimental approach, the study first identifies distinguishable color stimuli for hue, saturation, and intensity through preliminary experiments, followed by a large-scale human categorization survey involving more than 1000 human subjects. The resulting data are used to extract fuzzy partitions and generate membership functions that reflect real-world perceptual uncertainty. The model incorporates a mechanism for adaptation that allows refinement based on feedback and contextual changes. Comparative evaluations demonstrate the model's alignment with human perception compared to traditional color models, such as RGB, HSV, and LAB. To the best of our knowledge, no previous research has documented the construction of a model for color attribute specification based on a sample of this size or a comparable sample of the human population (n = 2496). Our findings are significant for fields such as design, artificial intelligence, marketing, and human-computer interaction, where perceptually relevant color representation is critical.</p>
