                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled image-based question-answering capabilities. However, a key limitation is the use of CLIP as the visual encoder; while it can capture coarse global information, it often can miss fine-grained details that are relevant to the input query. To address these shortcomings, this work studies whether pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models can serve as instruction-aware visual encoders. Through an analysis of their internal representations, we find diffusion features are both rich in semantics and can encode strong image-text alignment. Moreover, we find that we can leverage text conditioning to focus the model on regions relevant to the input question. We then investigate how to align these features with large language models and uncover a leakage phenomenon, where the LLM can inadvertently recover information from the original diffusion prompt. We analyze the causes of this leakage and propose a mitigation strategy. Based on these insights, we explore a simple fusion strategy that utilizes both CLIP and conditional diffusion features. We evaluate our approach on both general VQA and specialized MLLM benchmarks, demonstrating the promise of diffusion models for visual understanding, particularly in vision-centric tasks that require spatial and compositional reasoning.

                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> We present 4KAgent, a unified agentic super-resolution generalist system designed to universally upscale any image to 4K resolution (and even higher, if applied iteratively). Our system can transform images from extremely low resolutions with severe degradations, for example, highly distorted inputs at 256x256, into crystal-clear, photorealistic 4K outputs. 4KAgent comprises three core components: (1) Profiling, a module that customizes the 4KAgent pipeline based on bespoke use cases; (2) A Perception Agent, which leverages vision-language models alongside image quality assessment experts to analyze the input image and make a tailored restoration plan; and (3) A Restoration Agent, which executes the plan, following a recursive execution-reflection paradigm, guided by a quality-driven mixture-of-expert policy to select the optimal output for each step. Additionally, 4KAgent embeds a specialized face restoration pipeline, significantly enhancing facial details in portrait and selfie photos. We rigorously evaluate our 4KAgent across 11 distinct task categories encompassing a total of 26 diverse benchmarks, setting new state-of-the-art on a broad spectrum of imaging domains. Our evaluations cover natural images, portrait photos, AI-generated content, satellite imagery, fluorescence microscopy, and medical imaging like fundoscopy, ultrasound, and X-ray, demonstrating superior performance in terms of both perceptual (e.g., NIQE, MUSIQ) and fidelity (e.g., PSNR) metrics. By establishing a novel agentic paradigm for low-level vision tasks, we aim to catalyze broader interest and innovation within vision-centric autonomous agents across diverse research communities.

                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Building state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong captioning capabilities typically necessitates training on billions of high-quality image-text pairs, requiring millions of GPU hours. This paper introduces the Vision-Language-Vision (VLV) auto-encoder framework, which strategically leverages key pretrained components: a vision encoder, the decoder of a Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion model, and subsequently, a Large Language Model (LLM). Specifically, we establish an information bottleneck by regularizing the language representation space, achieved through freezing the pretrained T2I diffusion decoder. Our VLV pipeline effectively distills knowledge from the text-conditioned diffusion model using continuous embeddings, demonstrating comprehensive semantic understanding via high-quality reconstructions. Furthermore, by fine-tuning a pretrained LLM to decode the intermediate language representations into detailed descriptions, we construct a state-of-the-art (SoTA) captioner comparable to leading models like GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash. Our method demonstrates exceptional cost-efficiency and significantly reduces data requirements; by primarily utilizing single-modal images for training and maximizing the utility of existing pretrained models (image encoder, T2I diffusion model, and LLM), it circumvents the need for massive paired image-text datasets, keeping the total training expenditure under $1,000 USD.</p>

                <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07102v1" target="_blank">Does Data Scaling Lead to Visual Compositional Generalization?</a></h3>
                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arnas Uselis, Andrea Dittadi, Seong Joon Oh</p>
                <p><strong>Published:</strong> 7/9/2025</p>

                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Compositional understanding is crucial for human intelligence, yet it remains unclear whether contemporary vision models exhibit it. The dominant machine learning paradigm is built on the premise that scaling data and model sizes will improve out-of-distribution performance, including compositional generalization. We test this premise through controlled experiments that systematically vary data scale, concept diversity, and combination coverage. We find that compositional generalization is driven by data diversity, not mere data scale. Increased combinatorial coverage forces models to discover a linearly factored representational structure, where concepts decompose into additive components. We prove this structure is key to efficiency, enabling perfect generalization from few observed combinations. Evaluating pretrained models (DINO, CLIP), we find above-random yet imperfect performance, suggesting partial presence of this structure. Our work motivates stronger emphasis on constructing diverse datasets for compositional generalization, and considering the importance of representational structure that enables efficient compositional learning.

                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Particle filters are computational techniques for estimating the state of dynamical systems by integrating observational data with model predictions. This work introduces a class of Localized Particle Filters (LPFs) that exploit spatial localization to reduce computational costs and mitigate particle degeneracy in high-dimensional systems. By partitioning the state space into smaller regions and performing particle weight updates and resampling separately within each region, these filters leverage assumptions of limited spatial correlation to achieve substantial computational gains. This approach proves particularly valuable for geophysical data assimilation applications, including weather forecasting and ocean modeling, where system dimensions are vast, and complex interactions and nonlinearities demand efficient yet accurate state estimation methods. We demonstrate the methodology on a partially observed rotating shallow water system, achieving favourable performance in terms of algorithm stability and error estimates.</p>

                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Conventional wisdom dictates that small batch sizes make language model pretraining and fine-tuning unstable, motivating gradient accumulation, which trades off the number of optimizer steps for a proportional increase in batch size. While it is common to decrease the learning rate for smaller batch sizes, other hyperparameters are often held fixed. In this work, we revisit small batch sizes all the way down to batch size one, and we propose a rule for scaling Adam hyperparameters to small batch sizes. We find that small batch sizes (1) train stably, (2) are consistently more robust to hyperparameter choices, (3) achieve equal or better per-FLOP performance than larger batch sizes, and (4) notably enable stable language model training with vanilla SGD, even without momentum, despite storing no optimizer state. Building on these results, we provide practical recommendations for selecting a batch size and setting optimizer hyperparameters. We further recommend against gradient accumulation unless training on multiple devices with multiple model replicas, bottlenecked by inter-device bandwidth.</p>

                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lan Li, Da-Wei Zhou, Han-Jia Ye, De-Chuan Zhan</p>
                <p><strong>Published:</strong> 7/9/2025</p>
                <p><strong>Categories:</strong> cs.LG, cs.CV</p>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Domain-Incremental Learning (DIL) focuses on continual learning in non-stationary environments, requiring models to adjust to evolving domains while preserving historical knowledge. DIL faces two critical challenges in the context of imbalanced data: intra-domain class imbalance and cross-domain class distribution shifts. These challenges significantly hinder model performance, as intra-domain imbalance leads to underfitting of few-shot classes, while cross-domain shifts require maintaining well-learned many-shot classes and transferring knowledge to improve few-shot class performance in old domains. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the Dual-Balance Collaborative Experts (DCE) framework. DCE employs a frequency-aware expert group, where each expert is guided by specialized loss functions to learn features for specific frequency groups, effectively addressing intra-domain class imbalance. Subsequently, a dynamic expert selector is learned by synthesizing pseudo-features through balanced Gaussian sampling from historical class statistics. This mechanism navigates the trade-off between preserving many-shot knowledge of previous domains and leveraging new data to improve few-shot class performance in earlier tasks. Extensive experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate DCE's state-of-the-art performance.</p>

                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Non-Hermitian systems hosting exceptional points (EPs) exhibit enhanced sensitivity and unconventional mode dynamics. Going beyond isolated EPs, here we report on the existence of exceptional rings (ERs) in planar optical resonators with specific form of circular dichroism and TE-TM splitting. Such exceptional rings possess intriguing topologies as discussed earlier for condensed matter systems, but they remain virtually unexplored in presence of nonlinearity, for which our photonic platform is ideal. We find that when Kerr-type nonlinearity (or saturable gain) is introduced, the linear ER splits into two concentric ERs, with the larger-radius ring being a ring of third-order EPs. Transitioning from linear to nonlinear regime, we present a rigorous analysis of spectral topology and report enhanced and adjustable perturbation response in the nonlinear regime. Whereas certain features are specific to our system, the results on non-Hermitian spectral topology and nonlinearity-enhanced perturbation response are generic and equally relevant to a broad class of other nonlinear non-Hermitian systems, providing a universal framework for engineering ERs and EPs in nonlinear non-Hermitian systems.</p>

                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Gamma-ray-bright active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been one of the most promising source classes of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos detected by IceCube. The first evidence of an IceCube point source was a blazar detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT), TXS ~0506+056. Previous analyses have ruled out GeV-bright blazars as the predominant contributor to the high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux under simple correlation assumptions about the relationship between the fluxes of gamma rays and neutrinos. We present results from a more general and more sensitive search for correlation between neutrinos and GeV-selected AGN using improvements in the IceCube statistical methods and 13 years of data. We detect no correlation and set stringent constraints on neutrino emission by populations of GeV-detected AGN. These include constraints on the neutrino emission from subclasses of GeV-detected AGN, including BL Lacs, flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQ) and non-blazar AGN, using stacking analyses testing a variety of hypothesized relationships between neutrino and gamma-ray flux. We also present results from an analysis that is sensitive to a wider range of relationships between the gamma-ray and neutrino signal.</p>

                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Generating diverse and natural human motion sequences based on textual descriptions constitutes a fundamental and challenging research area within the domains of computer vision, graphics, and robotics. Despite significant advancements in this field, current methodologies often face challenges regarding zero-shot generalization capabilities, largely attributable to the limited size of training datasets. Moreover, the lack of a comprehensive evaluation framework impedes the advancement of this task by failing to identify directions for improvement. In this work, we aim to push text-to-motion into a new era, that is, to achieve the generalization ability of zero-shot. To this end, firstly, we develop an efficient annotation pipeline and introduce MotionMillion-the largest human motion dataset to date, featuring over 2,000 hours and 2 million high-quality motion sequences. Additionally, we propose MotionMillion-Eval, the most comprehensive benchmark for evaluating zero-shot motion generation. Leveraging a scalable architecture, we scale our model to 7B parameters and validate its performance on MotionMillion-Eval. Our results demonstrate strong generalization to out-of-domain and complex compositional motions, marking a significant step toward zero-shot human motion generation.
