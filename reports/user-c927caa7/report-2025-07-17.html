                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> We study the realization of $\mathsf{C}$, $\mathsf{P}$, $\mathsf{T}$ in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM - corresponding to charge conjugation, parity, and time-reversal - and identify the $\mathsf{C}$, $\mathsf{P}$, $\mathsf{T}$ global symmetries of ${\cal N}=4$ SYM with bulk (gauge) symmetries of string theory on $AdS_5\times S^5$. The dual bulk transformations are symmetries of Type IIB string theory on $AdS_5\times S^5$ that combine string worldsheet symmetries, with geometric transformations acting on $AdS_5\times S^5$. We show that $\mathsf P$ and $\mathsf T$ map to $\mathsf{CP}$ and $\mathsf{CT}$ under $S$-duality (combined with an $SU(4)$ R-symmetry outer automorphism), while $\mathsf C$ and $ \mathsf{CPT}$ are invariant. We also define a chiral, codimension-two surface defect in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM associated with charge conjugation, and provide its bulk $AdS_5\times S^5$ dual gravitational description.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Every data selection method inherently has a target. In practice, these targets often emerge implicitly through benchmark-driven iteration: researchers develop selection strategies, train models, measure benchmark performance, then refine accordingly. This raises a natural question: what happens when we make this optimization explicit? To explore this, we propose benchmark-targeted ranking (BETR), a simple method that selects pretraining documents based on similarity to benchmark training examples. BETR embeds benchmark examples and a sample of pretraining documents in a shared space, scores this sample by similarity to benchmarks, then trains a lightweight classifier to predict these scores for the full corpus. We compare data selection methods by training over 500 models spanning $10^{19}$ to $10^{22}$ FLOPs and fitting scaling laws to them. From this, we find that simply aligning pretraining data to evaluation benchmarks using BETR achieves a 2.1x compute multiplier over DCLM-Baseli...</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> 3D modeling is moving from virtual to physical. Existing 3D generation primarily emphasizes geometries and textures while neglecting physical-grounded modeling. Consequently, despite the rapid development of 3D generative models, the synthesized 3D assets often overlook rich and important physical properties, hampering their real-world application in physical domains like simulation and embodied AI. As an initial attempt to address this challenge, we propose \textbf{PhysX}, an end-to-end paradigm for physical-grounded 3D asset generation. 1) To bridge the critical gap in physics-annotated 3D datasets, we present PhysXNet - the first physics-grounded 3D dataset systematically annotated across five foundational dimensions: absolute scale, material, affordance, kinematics, and function description. In particular, we devise a scalable human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline based on vision-language models, which enables efficient creation of physics-first assets from raw 3D assets.2) Further...</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) emerged as a promising tool for mechanistic interpretability of transformer-based foundation models. Very recently, SAEs were also adopted for the visual domain, enabling the discovery of visual concepts and their patch-wise attribution to tokens in the transformer model. While a growing number of foundation models emerged for medical imaging, tools for explaining their inferences are still lacking. In this work, we show the applicability of SAEs for hematology. We propose CytoSAE, a sparse autoencoder which is trained on over 40,000 peripheral blood single-cell images. CytoSAE generalizes to diverse and out-of-domain datasets, including bone marrow cytology, where it identifies morphologically relevant concepts which we validated with medical experts. Furthermore, we demonstrate scenarios in which CytoSAE can generate patient-specific and disease-specific concepts, enabling the detection of pathognomonic cells and localized cellular abnormalities at the patc...</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Energy-efficient high-bandwidth interconnects play a key role in computing systems. Advances in silicon photonic electro-optic modulators and wavelength selective components have enabled the utilization of wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) in integrated optical transceivers, offering a high data-rate operation while achieving enhanced energy efficiency, bandwidth density, scalability, and the reach required for data-centers. Here, we report the demonstration of a single chip optical WDM PAM4 receiver, where by co-integration of a 32-channel optical demultiplexer (O-DeMux) with autonomous wavelength tuning and locking at a near-zero power consumption and a 32-channel ultra-low power concurrent electrical detection system, a record chip energy efficiency of under 0.38 pJ/bit is measured.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Modeling latent representations in a hyperspherical space has proven effective for capturing directional similarities in high-dimensional text data, benefiting topic modeling. Variational autoencoder-based neural topic models (VAE-NTMs) commonly adopt the von Mises-Fisher prior to encode hyperspherical structure. However, VAE-NTMs often suffer from posterior collapse, where the KL divergence term in the objective function highly diminishes, leading to ineffective latent representations. To mitigate this issue while modeling hyperspherical structure in the latent space, we propose the Spherical Sliced Wasserstein Autoencoder for Topic Modeling (S2WTM). S2WTM employs a prior distribution supported on the unit hypersphere and leverages the Spherical Sliced-Wasserstein distance to align the aggregated posterior distribution with the prior. Experimental results demonstrate that S2WTM outperforms state-of-the-art topic models, generating more coherent and diverse topics while improving perfo...</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Obstacle avoidance is essential for ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles. Accurate perception and motion planning are crucial to enabling vehicles to navigate complex environments while avoiding collisions. In this paper, we propose an efficient obstacle avoidance pipeline that leverages a camera-only perception module and a Frenet-Pure Pursuit-based planning strategy. By integrating advancements in computer vision, the system utilizes YOLOv11 for object detection and state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation models, such as Depth Anything V2, to estimate object distances. A comparative analysis of these models provides valuable insights into their accuracy, efficiency, and robustness in real-world conditions. The system is evaluated in diverse scenarios on a university campus, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling various obstacles and enhancing autonomous navigation.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The demand for machine intelligence capable of processing continuous, long-context inputs on local devices is growing rapidly. However, the quadratic complexity and memory requirements of traditional Transformer architectures make them inefficient and often unusable for these tasks. This has spurred a paradigm shift towards new architectures like State Space Models (SSMs) and hybrids, which promise near-linear scaling. While most current research focuses on the accuracy and theoretical throughput of these models, a systematic performance characterization on practical consumer hardware is critically needed to guide system-level optimization and unlock new applications. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive, comparative benchmarking of carefully selected Transformer, SSM, and hybrid models specifically for long-context inference on consumer and embedded GPUs.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Recent progress has been made in region-aware vision-language modeling, particularly with the emergence of the Describe Anything Model (DAM). DAM is capable of generating detailed descriptions of any specific image areas or objects without the need for additional localized image-text alignment supervision. We hypothesize that such region-level descriptive capability is beneficial for the task of Visual Question Answering (VQA), especially in challenging scenarios involving images with dense text. In such settings, the fine-grained extraction of textual information is crucial to producing correct answers. Motivated by this, we introduce DAM-QA, a framework with a tailored evaluation protocol, developed to investigate and harness the region-aware capabilities from DAM for the text-rich VQA problem that requires reasoning over text-based information within images.

However, it has been proved empirically that smaller funds perform better than the big ones in terms of their internal rates of return (IRRs). This work questions this authoritative view, providing evidence of outperformance of smaller funds relative to their larger counterparts.

However, current models often fail to adequately consider dynamic traffic signals and contextual scene information, which are critical for real-world applications. This paper presents a Traffic-Aware Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (TA-STGCN) that integrates traffic signs and their states (Red, Yellow, Green) into pedestrian intention prediction. Our approach introduces the integration of dynamic traffic signal states and bounding box size as key features, allowing the model to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies in complex urban environments. The model surpasses existing methods in accuracy. Specifically, TA-STGCN achieves a 4.75% higher accuracy compared to the baseline model on the PIE dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving pedestrian intention prediction.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Open-weights reasoning language models generate long chains-of-thought (CoTs) before producing a final response, which improves performance but introduces additional alignment risks, with harmful content often appearing in both the CoTs and the final outputs. In this work, we investigate if we can use CoTs to predict final response misalignment. We evaluate a range of monitoring approaches, including humans, highly-capable large language models, and text classifiers, using either CoT text or activations. First, we find that a simple linear probe trained on CoT activations can significantly outperform all text-based methods in predicting whether a final response will be safe or unsafe. CoT texts are often unfaithful and can mislead humans and classifiers, while model latents (i.e., CoT activations) offer a more reliable predictive signal. Second, the probe makes accurate predictions before reasoning completes, achieving strong performance even when applied to early CoT segments.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce a Mixture of Raytraced Experts, a stacked Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture which can dynamically select sequences of experts, producing computational graphs of variable width and depth. Existing MoE architectures generally require a fixed amount of computation for a given sample. Our approach, in contrast, yields predictions with increasing accuracy as the computation cycles through the experts sequence. We train our model by iteratively sampling from a set of candidate experts, unfolding the sequence akin to how Recurrent Neural Networks are trained. Our method does not require load-balancing mechanisms, and preliminary experiments show a reduction in training epochs of 10\% to 40\% with a comparable/higher accuracy. These results point to new research directions in the field of MoEs, allowing the design of potentially faster and more expressive models.

Here, we demonstrate for the first time that non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on electroencephalography (EEG) can decode spontaneous, fine-grained egocentric 6D pose, comprising three-dimensional position and orientation, during passive viewing of egocentric video. Despite EEGs limited spatial resolution and high signal noise, we find that spatially coherent visual input (i.e., continuous and structured motion) reliably evokes decodable spatial representations, aligning with participants subjective sense of spatial engagement. Decoding performance further improves when visual input is presented at a frame rate of...</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) retrieves relevant images based on a reference image and accompanying text describing desired modifications. However, existing CIR methods only focus on retrieving the target image and disregard the relevance of other images. This limitation arises because most methods employing contrastive learning-which treats the target image as positive and all other images in the batch as negatives-can inadvertently include false negatives. This may result in retrieving irrelevant images, reducing user satisfaction even when the target image is retrieved. To address this issue, we propose Query-Relevant Retrieval through Hard Negative Sampling (QuRe), which optimizes a reward model objective to reduce false negatives. Additionally, we introduce a hard negative sampling strategy that selects images positioned between two steep drops in relevance scores following the target image, to effectively filter false negatives. In order to evaluate CIR models on their alignment...</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Quasi-differentiable functions were introduced by Pshenichnyi in a 1969 monograph written in Russian and translated in an English version in 1971. This class of nonsmooth functions was studied extensively in two decades since but has not received much attention in todays wide optimization literature. This regrettable omission is in spite of the fact that many functions in modern day applications of optimization can be shown to be quasi-differentiable. In essence, a quasi-differentiable function is one whose directional derivative at an arbitrary reference vector, as a function of the direction, is the difference of two positively homogenous, convex functions. Thus, to bring quasi-differentiable functions closer to the class of difference-of-convex functions that has received fast growing attention in recent years in connection with many applied subjects, we propose to rename quasi-differentiable functions as quasi-difference-convex (quasi-dc) functions.

When labeled data is limited, textual information can provide additional context to enhance visual semantic understanding. However, research exploring the use of textual data to enhance visual semantic embeddings in 3D medical imaging tasks remains scarce. In this paper, we propose a novel text-driven multiplanar visual interaction framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation (termed Text-SemiSeg), which consists of three main modules: Text-enhanced Multiplanar Representation (TMR), Category-aware Semantic Alignment (CSA), and Dynamic Cognitive Augmentation (DCA). Specifically, TMR facilitates text-visual interaction through planar mapping, thereby enhancing the category awareness of visual features.

We borrow a deconstruction approach from literary critique to explore the instability of meaning in language and reveal implicit beliefs in words and ideas. Through our analysis we surface two sets of opposing implicit beliefs in visual data journalism: objectivity/subjectivity and humanism/mechanism. We contextualize these beliefs through a genealogical analysis, which brings deconstruction theory into practice by providing a historic backdrop for these opposing perspectives.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Gender bias has been widely observed in speech perception tasks, influenced by the fundamental voicing differences between genders. This study reveals a gender bias in the perception of Alzheimers Disease (AD) speech. In a perception experiment involving 16 Chinese listeners evaluating both Chinese and Greek speech, we identified that male speech was more frequently identified as AD, with this bias being particularly pronounced in Chinese speech. Acoustic analysis showed that shimmer values in male speech were significantly associated with AD perception, while speech portion exhibited a significant negative correlation with AD identification. Although language did not have a significant impact on AD perception, our findings underscore the critical role of gender bias in AD speech perception. This work highlights the necessity of addressing gender bias when developing AD detection models and calls for further research to validate model performance across different linguistic contexts.</p>

In this setting the assumption is that it is possible to produce reliable forecasts for the super-population, but the sub-populations may be too small or lack sufficient history to produce reliable forecasts if modelled separately. This setup is aligned with the ideas that underpin credibility theory, and in the present paper the classical credibility theory approach is extended to be able to handle the situation where future mortality rates are driven by a latent stochastic process, as is the case for, e.g., Lee-Carter type models. This results in sub-population credibility predictors that are weighted averages of expected future super-population mortality rates and expected future sub-population specific mortality rates.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> We present the first application of marked angular power spectra to weak lensing data, using maps from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam Year 1 (HSC-Y1) survey. Marked convergence fields, constructed by weighting the convergence field with non-linear functions of its smoothed version, are designed to encode higher-order information while remaining computationally tractable. Using simulations tailored to the HSC-Y1 data, we test three mark functions that up- or down-weight different density environments.

When applied to the HSC-Y1 data, this translates into a constraint on $S_8 = 0.807\pm 0.024$.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> While reinforcement learning-trained Large Reasoning Models (LRMs, e.g., Deepseek-R1) demonstrate advanced reasoning capabilities in the evolving Large Language Models (LLMs) domain, their susceptibility to security threats remains a critical vulnerability. This weakness is particularly evident in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation processes, where adversarial methods like backdoor prompt attacks can systematically subvert the models core reasoning mechanisms. The emerging Chain-of-Thought Attack (CoTA) reveals this vulnerability through exploiting prompt controllability, simultaneously degrading both CoT safety and task performance with low-cost interventions. To address this compounded security-performance vulnerability, we propose Thought Purity (TP): a defense paradigm that systematically strengthens resistance to malicious content while preserving operational efficacy.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely used across diverse NLP tasks and domains, demonstrating their adaptability and effectiveness. In the realm of Electronic Design Automation (EDA), LLMs show promise for tasks like Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation and summarization. However, despite the proliferation of LLMs for general code-related tasks, theres a dearth of research focused on evaluating and refining these models for hardware description languages (HDLs), notably VHDL. In this study, we evaluate the performance of existing code LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization using various metrics and two datasets -- VHDL-Eval and VHDL-Xform. The latter, an in-house dataset, aims to gauge LLMs understanding of functionally equivalent code. Our findings reveal consistent underperformance of these models across different metrics, underscoring a significant gap in their suitability for this domain.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> We present Mass-Conserving Evolution (MaCE), a general method for implementing mass conservation in Cellular Automata (CA). MaCE is a simple evolution rule that can be easily attached to existing CAs to make them mass-conserving, which tends to produce interesting behaviours more often, as patterns can no longer explode or die out. We first show that MaCE is numerically stable and admits a simple continuous limit. We then test MaCE on Lenia, and through several experiments, we demonstrate that it produces a wide variety of interesting behaviours, starting from the variety and abundance of solitons up to hints of intrinsic evolution in resource-constrained environments. Finally, we showcase the versatility of MaCE by applying it to Neural-CAs and discrete CAs, and discuss promising research directions opened up by this scheme.</p>

These planar metallic constrictions, which naturally exhibit Josephsonlike behavior, offer a fundamental platform for investigating nonreciprocal transport phenomena in a regime where the bridge width aligns with the superconducting coherence length. The foundational concept is inspired by the Tesla valve, a classical fluidic device that achieves flow rectification through interference and turbulence between fluid streams enabled by geometric asymmetry. Analogously, we demonstrate that spatial asymmetry within superconducting structures can result in rectification due to the polarity-dependent interaction between transport and screening currents.

While linear wave theory provides a first-order description of wave motion, real-world oceanic environments are governed by nonlinear interactions that are responsible for a transfer of energy between waves of different lengths. The pioneering research by O. Phillips, K. Hasselmann, and V. Zakharov in the 1960s introduced the concept that four-wave resonant interactions serve as the primary mechanism for energy transfers among wave components in oceanic surface wave fields. Although the presence and efficiency of these resonant interactions have been demonstrated in controlled determinist wave tank experiments, their direct identification in the real ocean, where a large number of random waves interact, has remained elusive.

Defined by oxygen dependence at 36 weeks postmenstrual age, it causes lifelong respiratory complications. However, preventive interventions carry severe risks, including neurodevelopmental impairment, ventilator-induced lung injury, and systemic complications.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> We explore the interplay of the post-inflationary QCD axion and a light scalar field for the axion domain wall decay and dark matter (DM). The scalar field possesses a nonzero vacuum expectation value (VEV) during inflation, so that its interaction with the axion effectively serves as an explicit Peccei-Quinn (PQ) violating term. At a temperature below the PQ phase transition, the effective PQ violating interaction generates the axion potential which generally contains multiple degenerate vacua leading to the formation of the axion string-domain wall networks. The following QCD phase transition provides another contribution to the axion potential making domain walls decay before they dominate the Universe. Later, the scalar field starts to relax to the minimum of its potential with a vanishing VEV, turning off the effective PQ violating interaction so that the axion potential is aligned with the QCD vacuum. We keep track of the evolution of the axion-scalar system and discuss the produ...</p>

Using temporal data on 25.2 million publications and 31.8 million authors, we propose a novel network-driven approach to identify and study the success of persistent teams. Challenging the idea that persistence alone drives success, we find that team freshness - new collaborations built on prior experience - is key to success. High impact research tends to emerge early in a teams lifespan. Analyzing complex team overlap, we find that teams open to new collaborative ties consistently produce better science. Specifically, team re-combinations that introduce new freshness impulses sustain success, while persistence impulses from experienced teams are linked to earlier impact. Together, freshness and persistence shape team success across collaboration stages.</p>

Design automation in the QEC flow is thus critical, enabling automated synthesis, transpilation, layout, and verification of error-corrected circuits to reduce qubit footprints and push fault-tolerance margins.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Recent research has focused extensively on constructing binary self-orthogonal (SO) linear codes due to their applications in quantum information theory, lattice design, and related areas. Despite significant activity, the fundamental characterization remains unchanged: binary SO codes are necessarily even (all codeword weights even), while doubly-even codes (weights divisible by $4$) are automatically SO. This paper advances the theory by addressing the understudied case of singly-even (even but not doubly-even) SO codes. We first provide a complete characterization of binary SO linear codes, and a necessary and sufficient condition for binary SO singly-even linear codes is given. Moreover, we give a general approach to generating many binary SO linear codes from two known SO linear codes, yielding three infinite classes of binary SO singly-even linear codes with few weights.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Phrase grounding, i.e., mapping natural language phrases to specific image regions, holds significant potential for disease localization in medical imaging through clinical reports. While current state-of-the-art methods rely on discriminative, self-supervised contrastive models, we demonstrate that generative text-to-image diffusion models, leveraging cross-attention maps, can achieve superior zero-shot phrase grounding performance. Contrary to prior assumptions, we show that fine-tuning diffusion models with a frozen, domain-specific language model, such as CXR-BERT, substantially outperforms domain-agnostic counterparts. This setup achieves remarkable improvements, with mIoU scores doubling those of current discriminative methods. These findings highlight the underexplored potential of generative models for phrase grounding tasks.
