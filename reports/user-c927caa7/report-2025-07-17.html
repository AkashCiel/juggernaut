                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> We study the realization of $\mathsf{C}$, $\mathsf{P}$, $\mathsf{T}$ in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM - corresponding to charge conjugation, parity, and time-reversal - and identify the $\mathsf{C}$, $\mathsf{P}$, $\mathsf{T}$ global symmetries of ${\cal N}=4$ SYM with bulk (gauge) symmetries of string theory on $AdS_5\times S^5$. The dual bulk transformations are symmetries of Type IIB string theory on $AdS_5\times S^5$ that combine string worldsheet symmetries, with geometric transformations acting on $AdS_5\times S^5$. We show that $\mathsf P$ and $\mathsf T$ map to $\mathsf{CP}$ and $\mathsf{CT}$ under $S$-duality (combined with an $SU(4)$ R-symmetry outer automorphism), while $\mathsf C$ and $ \mathsf{CPT}$ are invariant. We also define a chiral, codimension-two surface defect in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM associated with charge conjugation, and provide its bulk $AdS_5\times S^5$ dual gravitational description.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Every data selection method inherently has a target. In practice, these targets often emerge implicitly through benchmark-driven iteration: researchers develop selection strategies, train models, measure benchmark performance, then refine accordingly. This raises a natural question: what happens when we make this optimization explicit? To explore this, we propose benchmark-targeted ranking (BETR), a simple method that selects pretraining documents based on similarity to benchmark training examples. BETR embeds benchmark examples and a sample of pretraining documents in a shared space, scores this sample by similarity to benchmarks, then trains a lightweight classifier to predict these scores for the full corpus. We compare data selection methods by training over 500 models spanning $10^{19}$ to $10^{22}$ FLOPs and fitting scaling laws to them. From this, we find that simply aligning pretraining data to evaluation benchmarks using BETR achieves a 2.1x compute multiplier over DCLM-Baseli...</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> 3D modeling is moving from virtual to physical. Existing 3D generation primarily emphasizes geometries and textures while neglecting physical-grounded modeling. Consequently, despite the rapid development of 3D generative models, the synthesized 3D assets often overlook rich and important physical properties, hampering their real-world application in physical domains like simulation and embodied AI. As an initial attempt to address this challenge, we propose \textbf{PhysX}, an end-to-end paradigm for physical-grounded 3D asset generation. 1) To bridge the critical gap in physics-annotated 3D datasets, we present PhysXNet - the first physics-grounded 3D dataset systematically annotated across five foundational dimensions: absolute scale, material, affordance, kinematics, and function description. In particular, we devise a scalable human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline based on vision-language models, which enables efficient creation of physics-first assets from raw 3D assets.2) Further...</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) emerged as a promising tool for mechanistic interpretability of transformer-based foundation models. Very recently, SAEs were also adopted for the visual domain, enabling the discovery of visual concepts and their patch-wise attribution to tokens in the transformer model. While a growing number of foundation models emerged for medical imaging, tools for explaining their inferences are still lacking. In this work, we show the applicability of SAEs for hematology. We propose CytoSAE, a sparse autoencoder which is trained on over 40,000 peripheral blood single-cell images. CytoSAE generalizes to diverse and out-of-domain datasets, including bone marrow cytology, where it identifies morphologically relevant concepts which we validated with medical experts. Furthermore, we demonstrate scenarios in which CytoSAE can generate patient-specific and disease-specific concepts, enabling the detection of pathognomonic cells and localized cellular abnormalities at the patc...</p>

Although recent progress has explored various aspects of human behavior$\unicode{x2014}$such as motion, trajectories, and intention$\unicode{x2014}$a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating human behavior understanding in autonomous driving remains unavailable.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> We present SpatialTrackerV2, a feed-forward 3D point tracking method for monocular videos. Going beyond modular pipelines built on off-the-shelf components for 3D tracking, our approach unifies the intrinsic connections between point tracking, monocular depth, and camera pose estimation into a high-performing and feedforward 3D point tracker. It decomposes world-space 3D motion into scene geometry, camera ego-motion, and pixel-wise object motion, with a fully differentiable and end-to-end architecture, allowing scalable training across a wide range of datasets, including synthetic sequences, posed RGB-D videos, and unlabeled in-the-wild footage. By learning geometry and motion jointly from such heterogeneous data, SpatialTrackerV2 outperforms existing 3D tracking methods by 30%, and matches the accuracy of leading dynamic 3D reconstruction approaches while running 50$\times$ faster.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Radiologists rely on eye movements to navigate and interpret medical images. A trained radiologist possesses knowledge about the potential diseases that may be present in the images and, when searching, follows a mental checklist to locate them using their gaze. This is a key observation, yet existing models fail to capture the underlying intent behind each fixation. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning-based approach, RadGazeIntent, designed to model this behavior: having an intention to find something and actively searching for it. Our transformer-based architecture processes both the temporal and spatial dimensions of gaze data, transforming fine-grained fixation features into coarse, meaningful representations of diagnostic intent to interpret radiologists goals. To capture the nuances of radiologists varied intention-driven behaviors, we process existing medical eye-tracking datasets to create three intention-labeled subsets: RadSeq (Systematic Sequential Search), RadExplor...</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The scalar spectral index $n_s$ is a powerful test of inflationary models. The tightest constraint on $n_s$ to date derives from the combination of cosmic microwave background (CMB) data with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data. The resulting $n_s$ constraint is shifted significantly upward relative to the constraint from CMB alone, with the consequence that previously preferred inflationary models are seemingly disfavored by $\gtrsim 2 \sigma$. Here we show that this shift in $n_s$ is the combined effect of a degeneracy between $n_s$ and BAO parameters exhibited by CMB data and the tension between CMB datasets and DESI BAO data under the assumption of the standard cosmological model. Given the crucial role of $n_s$ in discriminating between inflationary models, we urge caution in interpreting CMB+BAO constraints on $n_s$ until the BAO-CMB tension is resolved.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Using Bruns theorem relating the relative algebraic $K$-theory and the relative cyclic homology, we compute certain relative algebraic $K$-groups of a $p$-adic smooth scheme over $W_n(k)$, where $k$ is a perfect field of characteristic $p$. Inspired by this result and the work of Bloch, Esnault, and Kerz, we define the infinitesimal motivic complexes, and then show a relative Chern character isomorphism with integral coefficients in a range. This has a direct consequence on infinitesimal deformations in algebraic $K$-theory, which is related to the $p$-adic variational Hodge conjecture.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> One-shot signatures (OSS) were defined by Amos, Georgiou, Kiayias, and Zhandry (STOC20). These allow for signing exactly one message, after which the signing key self-destructs, preventing a second message from ever being signed. While such an object is impossible classically, Amos et al observe that OSS may be possible using quantum signing keys by leveraging the no-cloning principle. OSS has since become an important conceptual tool with many applications in decentralized settings and for quantum cryptography with classical communication. OSS are also closely related to separations between classical-binding and collapse-binding for post-quantum hashing and commitments. Unfortunately, the only known OSS construction due to Amos et al. was only justified in a classical oracle model, and moreover their justification was ultimately found to contain a fatal bug. Thus, the existence of OSS, even in a classical idealized model, has remained open. We give the first standard-model OSS, with p...</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have revolutionized cross-modal understanding but continue to struggle with hallucinations - fabricated content contradicting visual inputs. Existing hallucination mitigation methods either incur prohibitive computational costs or introduce distribution mismatches between training data and model outputs. We identify a critical insight: hallucinations predominantly emerge at the early stages of text generation and propagate through subsequent outputs.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Modeling latent representations in a hyperspherical space has proven effective for capturing directional similarities in high-dimensional text data, benefiting topic modeling. Variational autoencoder-based neural topic models (VAE-NTMs) commonly adopt the von Mises-Fisher prior to encode hyperspherical structure. However, VAE-NTMs often suffer from posterior collapse, where the KL divergence term in the objective function highly diminishes, leading to ineffective latent representations. To mitigate this issue while modeling hyperspherical structure in the latent space, we propose the Spherical Sliced Wasserstein Autoencoder for Topic Modeling (S2WTM). S2WTM employs a prior distribution supported on the unit hypersphere and leverages the Spherical Sliced-Wasserstein distance to align the aggregated posterior distribution with the prior. Experimental results demonstrate that S2WTM outperforms state-of-the-art topic models, generating more coherent and diverse topics while improving perfo...</p>

While high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gates have been demonstrated, the synthesis of efficient multi-qubit operations -- such as the Toffoli gate -- remains a key bottleneck. Conventional gate decompositions into elementary operations lead to prohibitively long and error-prone pulse sequences, limiting practical deployment. In this work, we introduce a gradient-based optimization algorithm, Jenga-Krotov (JK), tailored to discover compact, high-fidelity EO gate sequences. Applying JK to the Toffoli gate, we reduce the number of required exchange unitaries from 216 (in standard decomposition) to 92, and compress the time steps required from 162 to 50, all while maintaining target fidelity. Under realistic noise, the accumulated gate error from our optimized sequence is a...</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Reducing latency in the Internet of Things (IoT) is a critical concern. While cloud computing facilitates communication, it falls short of meeting real-time requirements reliably. Edge and fog computing have emerged as viable solutions by positioning computing nodes closer to end users, offering lower latency and increased processing power. An edge-fog framework comprises various components, including edge and fog nodes, whose strategic placement is crucial as it directly impacts latency and system cost. This paper presents an effective and tunable node placement strategy based on a genetic algorithm to address the optimization problem of deploying edge and fog nodes. The main objective is to minimize latency and cost through optimal node placement. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves up to 2.77% latency and 31.15% cost reduction.</p>

It has emerged as a prominent approach, particularly in leveraging bit-level sparsity in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, existing bit-serial accelerators exploit bit-level sparsity to reduce computations by skipping zero bits, but they suffer from inefficient memory accesses due to the irregular indices of the non-zero bits. As memory accesses typically are the dominant contributor to DNN accelerator performance, this paper introduces a novel computing approach called bit-column-serial and a compatible architecture design named BitWave. BitWave harnesses the advantages of the bit-column-serial approach, leveraging structured bit-level sparsity in combination with dynamic dataflow techniques.

However, the quadratic complexity and memory requirements of traditional Transformer architectures make them inefficient and often unusable for these tasks. This has spurred a paradigm shift towards new architectures like State Space Models (SSMs) and hybrids, which promise near-linear scaling. While most current research focuses on the accuracy and theoretical throughput of these models, a systematic performance characterization on practical consumer hardware is critically needed to guide system-level optimization and unlock new applications. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive, comparative benchmarking of carefully selected Transformer, SSM, and hybrid models specifically for long-context inference on consumer and embedded GPUs.

In such settings, the fine-grained extraction of textual information is crucial to producing correct answers. Motivated by this, we introduce DAM-QA, a framework with a tailored evaluation protocol, developed to investigate and harness the region-aware capabilities from DAM for the text-rich VQA problem that requires reasoning over text-based information within images.

We demonstrate that an \emph{off-grid} compressed sensing protocol, combined with a state-of-the-art signal classification method, enables the simultaneous estimation of multiple eigenvalues of a unitary matrix using the Hadamard test while sampling only a few percent of the full autocorrelation function. Our numerical evidence indicates that the proposed algorithm achieves the Heisenberg limit in both strongly and weakly correlated regimes and requires very short evolution times to obtain an $\epsilon$-accurate estimate of multiple eigenvalues at once. Additionally -- and of independent interest -- we develop a modified off-grid protocol that leverages prior knowledge of the underlying signal for faster and more accurate recovery.

Our approach introduces the integration of dynamic traffic signal states and bounding box size as key features, allowing the model to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies in complex urban environments.

Specifically, TA-STGCN achieves a 4.75% higher accuracy compared to the baseline model on the PIE dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving pedestrian intention prediction.</p>

However, the low-frequency planar modes of these crystals are not efficiently cooled by laser cooling, which can limit the utility of the drumhead modes for quantum information processing. Recently, it has been shown that nonlinear mode coupling can enhance the cooling of the low-frequency planar modes. Here, we demonstrate in numerical simulations that this coupling can be dynamically tuned by adiabatically changing the rotation frequency of the ion crystal during experiments. Furthermore, we show that this technique can, in addition, produce lower temperatures for the low-frequency planar modes via an adiabatic cooling process.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> This work experimentally investigates deformable nitrogen bubbles rising in ultrapure water and interacting with a vertical wall, focusing on how this downstream boundary alters their dynamics, an effect critical to many real-world processes. The experiments were conducted with a fixed Morton number, $Mo = 2.64 \times 10^{-11}$, with Bond, Galilei, and Reynolds numbers in the ranges $0.08 \lesssim Bo \lesssim 0.33$, $71 \lesssim Ga \lesssim 194$, and $132 \lesssim Re \lesssim 565$, respectively. The initial dimensionless horizontal distance between the wall and the bubble centroid was systematically varied, $0.3 \lesssim L \lesssim 5$, and the bubble trajectories from two orthogonal vertical planes were captured using high-speed imaging. While the bubble rising paths were stable without the wall presence for all the cases, the results reveal that wall proximity significantly affects the rising path, depending on $Bo$ (or $Ga$) and $L$.

We analyze the conditions for implementation of coherent interaction of SP mode with resonant atomic ensembles. By solving the Maxwell-Bloch equations that govern the resonant interaction of surface plasmons with atoms, we derive the modified area theorem, which makes it possible to identify the most common nonlinear patterns in the behavior of plasmons under the studied conditions.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Bounding box regression (BBR) is fundamental to object detection, where the regression loss is crucial for accurate localization. Existing IoU-based losses often incorporate handcrafted geometric penalties to address IoUs non-differentiability in non-overlapping cases and enhance BBR performance. However, these penalties are sensitive to box shape, size, and distribution, often leading to suboptimal optimization for small objects and undesired behaviors such as bounding box enlargement due to misalignment with the IoU objective. To address these limitations, we propose InterpIoU, a novel loss function that replaces handcrafted geometric penalties with a term based on the IoU between interpolated boxes and the target. By using interpolated boxes to bridge the gap between predictions and ground truth, InterpIoU provides meaningful gradients in non-overlapping cases and inherently avoids the box enlargement issue caused by misaligned penalties. Simulation results further show that IoU its...</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> We introduce a Mixture of Raytraced Experts, a stacked Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture which can dynamically select sequences of experts, producing computational graphs of variable width and depth. Existing MoE architectures generally require a fixed amount of computation for a given sample. Our approach, in contrast, yields predictions with increasing accuracy as the computation cycles through the experts sequence. We train our model by iteratively sampling from a set of candidate experts, unfolding the sequence akin to how Recurrent Neural Networks are trained. Our method does not require load-balancing mechanisms, and preliminary experiments show a reduction in training epochs of 10\% to 40\% with a comparable/higher accuracy. These results point to new research directions in the field of MoEs, allowing the design of potentially faster and more expressive models.

The efficiency of NTT computation directly impacts the overall performance of FHE, making hardware acceleration a critical technology that will enable realistic FHE applications. Custom accelerators, in FPGAs or ASICs, offer significant performance advantages due to their ability to exploit massive parallelism and specialized optimizations. However, the operation of NTT over large moduli requires large word-length modulo arithmetic that limits achievable clock frequencies in hardware and increases hardware area costs. To overcome such deficits, digit-serial arithmetic has been explored for modular multiplication and addition independently.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) retrieves relevant images based on a reference image and accompanying text describing desired modifications. However, existing CIR methods only focus on retrieving the target image and disregard the relevance of other images. This limitation arises because most methods employing contrastive learning-which treats the target image as positive and all other images in the batch as negatives-can inadvertently include false negatives. This may result in retrieving irrelevant images, reducing user satisfaction even when the target image is retrieved. To address this issue, we propose Query-Relevant Retrieval through Hard Negative Sampling (QuRe), which optimizes a reward model objective to reduce false negatives. Additionally, we introduce a hard negative sampling strategy that selects images positioned between two steep drops in relevance scores following the target image, to effectively filter false negatives. In order to evaluate CIR models on their alignment...</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Quasi-differentiable functions were introduced by Pshenichnyi in a 1969 monograph written in Russian and translated in an English version in 1971. This class of nonsmooth functions was studied extensively in two decades since but has not received much attention in todays wide optimization literature. This regrettable omission is in spite of the fact that many functions in modern day applications of optimization can be shown to be quasi-differentiable. In essence, a quasi-differentiable function is one whose directional derivative at an arbitrary reference vector, as a function of the direction, is the difference of two positively homogenous, convex functions. Thus, to bring quasi-differentiable functions closer to the class of difference-of-convex functions that has received fast growing attention in recent years in connection with many applied subjects, we propose to rename quasi-differentiable functions as quasi-difference-convex (quasi-dc) functions.

While quantum completeness and classical soundness of the construction have been established for all multipartite games, quantum soundness is known only in the special case of bipartite games. In this paper, we prove that the Kalai et al.s compiler indeed achieves quantum soundness for all multipartite compiled non-local games, by showing that any correlations that can be generated in the asymptotic case correspond to quantum commuting strategies.

We present a two-phase framework that combines neural networks (NN), feature importance analysis, and symbolic regression (SR) to discover interpretable descriptors for OER activity in oxide perovskites. In Phase I, using a small dataset and seven structural features, we reproduce and improve the known {\mu}/t descriptor by engineering composite features and applying symbolic regression, achieving training and validation MAEs of 22.8 and 20.8 meV, respectively.

This method avoids potential prior and volume effects that may arise in a comparable Bayesian analysis. Parabolic fits to the profiles allow one to distinguish changes in the upper limits from variations in the constraining power $\sigma$ of the different data combinations. We find that all profiles in the $\Lambda$CDM model are cut off by the $\sum m_\nu \geq 0$ bound, meaning that the corresponding parabolas reach their minimum in the unphysical sector.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Deploying motile nanosized particles, also known as ``nanobots, in the human body promises to improve selectivity in drug delivery and reduce side effects. We consider a swarm of nanobots locating a single cancerous region and treating it by releasing an onboard payload of drugs at the site. At nanoscale, the computation, communication, sensing, and locomotion capabilities of individual agents are extremely limited, noisy, and/or nonexistent. We present a general model to formally describe the individual and collective behavior of agents in a colloidal environment, such as the bloodstream, for cancer detection and treatment by nanobots. This includes a feasible and precise model of agent locomotion, inspired by actual nanoparticles that, in the presence of an external chemical gradient, move towards areas of higher concentration by means of self-propulsion. We present two variants of our general model: The first assumes an endogenous chemical gradient that is fixed over time and center...</p>
