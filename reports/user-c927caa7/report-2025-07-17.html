                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Every data selection method inherently has a target. In practice, these targets often emerge implicitly through benchmark-driven iteration: researchers develop selection strategies, train models, measure benchmark performance, then refine accordingly. This raises a natural question: what happens when we make this optimization explicit? To explore this, we propose benchmark-targeted ranking (BETR), a simple method that selects pretraining documents based on similarity to benchmark training examples. BETR embeds benchmark examples and a sample of pretraining documents in a shared space, scores this sample by similarity to benchmarks, then trains a lightweight classifier to predict these scores for the full corpus. We compare data selection methods by training over 500 models spanning $10^{19}$ to $10^{22}$ FLOPs and fitting scaling laws to them. From this, we find that simply aligning pretraining data to evaluation benchmarks using BETR achieves a 2.1x compute multiplier over DCLM-Baseli...</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) emerged as a promising tool for mechanistic interpretability of transformer-based foundation models. Very recently, SAEs were also adopted for the visual domain, enabling the discovery of visual concepts and their patch-wise attribution to tokens in the transformer model. While a growing number of foundation models emerged for medical imaging, tools for explaining their inferences are still lacking. In this work, we show the applicability of SAEs for hematology. We propose CytoSAE, a sparse autoencoder which is trained on over 40,000 peripheral blood single-cell images. CytoSAE generalizes to diverse and out-of-domain datasets, including bone marrow cytology, where it identifies morphologically relevant concepts which we validated with medical experts. Furthermore, we demonstrate scenarios in which CytoSAE can generate patient-specific and disease-specific concepts, enabling the detection of pathognomonic cells and localized cellular abnormalities at the patc...</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> We present SpatialTrackerV2, a feed-forward 3D point tracking method for monocular videos. Going beyond modular pipelines built on off-the-shelf components for 3D tracking, our approach unifies the intrinsic connections between point tracking, monocular depth, and camera pose estimation into a high-performing and feedforward 3D point tracker. It decomposes world-space 3D motion into scene geometry, camera ego-motion, and pixel-wise object motion, with a fully differentiable and end-to-end architecture, allowing scalable training across a wide range of datasets, including synthetic sequences, posed RGB-D videos, and unlabeled in-the-wild footage. By learning geometry and motion jointly from such heterogeneous data, SpatialTrackerV2 outperforms existing 3D tracking methods by 30%, and matches the accuracy of leading dynamic 3D reconstruction approaches while running 50$\times$ faster.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Radiologists rely on eye movements to navigate and interpret medical images. A trained radiologist possesses knowledge about the potential diseases that may be present in the images and, when searching, follows a mental checklist to locate them using their gaze. This is a key observation, yet existing models fail to capture the underlying intent behind each fixation. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning-based approach, RadGazeIntent, designed to model this behavior: having an intention to find something and actively searching for it. Our transformer-based architecture processes both the temporal and spatial dimensions of gaze data, transforming fine-grained fixation features into coarse, meaningful representations of diagnostic intent to interpret radiologists goals. To capture the nuances of radiologists varied intention-driven behaviors, we process existing medical eye-tracking datasets to create three intention-labeled subsets: RadSeq (Systematic Sequential Search), RadExplor...</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have revolutionized cross-modal understanding but continue to struggle with hallucinations - fabricated content contradicting visual inputs. Existing hallucination mitigation methods either incur prohibitive computational costs or introduce distribution mismatches between training data and model outputs. We identify a critical insight: hallucinations predominantly emerge at the early stages of text generation and propagate through subsequent outputs. To address this, we propose **SENTINEL** (**S**entence-level **E**arly i**N**tervention **T**hrough **IN**-domain pr**E**ference **L**earning), a framework that eliminates dependency on human annotations. Specifically, we first bootstrap high-quality in-domain preference pairs by iteratively sampling model outputs, validating object existence through cross-checking with two open-vocabulary detectors, and classifying sentences into hallucinated/non-hallucinated categories.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> In automated machine learning, scientific discovery, and other applications of Bayesian optimization, deciding when to stop evaluating expensive black-box functions is an important practical consideration. While several adaptive stopping rules have been proposed, in the cost-aware setting they lack guarantees ensuring they stop before incurring excessive function evaluation costs. We propose a cost-aware stopping rule for Bayesian optimization that adapts to varying evaluation costs and is free of heuristic tuning. Our rule is grounded in a theoretical connection to state-of-the-art cost-aware acquisition functions, namely the Pandoras Box Gittins Index (PBGI) and log expected improvement per cost. We prove a theoretical guarantee bounding the expected cumulative evaluation cost incurred by our stopping rule when paired with these two acquisition functions.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Energy-efficient high-bandwidth interconnects play a key role in computing systems. Advances in silicon photonic electro-optic modulators and wavelength selective components have enabled the utilization of wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) in integrated optical transceivers, offering a high data-rate operation while achieving enhanced energy efficiency, bandwidth density, scalability, and the reach required for data-centers.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Modeling latent representations in a hyperspherical space has proven effective for capturing directional similarities in high-dimensional text data, benefiting topic modeling. Variational autoencoder-based neural topic models (VAE-NTMs) commonly adopt the von Mises-Fisher prior to encode hyperspherical structure. However, VAE-NTMs often suffer from posterior collapse, where the KL divergence term in the objective function highly diminishes, leading to ineffective latent representations. To mitigate this issue while modeling hyperspherical structure in the latent space, we propose the Spherical Sliced Wasserstein Autoencoder for Topic Modeling (S2WTM). S2WTM employs a prior distribution supported on the unit hypersphere and leverages the Spherical Sliced-Wasserstein distance to align the aggregated posterior distribution with the prior. Experimental results demonstrate that S2WTM outperforms state-of-the-art topic models, generating more coherent and diverse topics while improving perfo...</p>

Accurate perception and motion planning are crucial to enabling vehicles to navigate complex environments while avoiding collisions. In this paper, we propose an efficient obstacle avoidance pipeline that leverages a camera-only perception module and a Frenet-Pure Pursuit-based planning strategy. By integrating advancements in computer vision, the system utilizes YOLOv11 for object detection and state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation models, such as Depth Anything V2, to estimate object distances. A comparative analysis of these models provides valuable insights into their accuracy, efficiency, and robustness in real-world conditions.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Exchange-only (EO) qubits, implemented in triple-quantum-dot systems, offer a compelling platform for scalable semiconductor-based quantum computing by enabling universal control through purely exchange interactions. While high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gates have been demonstrated, the synthesis of efficient multi-qubit operations -- such as the Toffoli gate -- remains a key bottleneck. Conventional gate decompositions into elementary operations lead to prohibitively long and error-prone pulse sequences, limiting practical deployment. In this work, we introduce a gradient-based optimization algorithm, Jenga-Krotov (JK), tailored to discover compact, high-fidelity EO gate sequences. Applying JK to the Toffoli gate, we reduce the number of required exchange unitaries from 216 (in standard decomposition) to 92, and compress the time steps required from 162 to 50, all while maintaining target fidelity.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Nearly all ultrawide-bandgap oxides are affected by hole localization that limits $p$-type conductivity and thus potential applications for these materials. Highly localized holes, also known as hole polarons, trap in the vicinity of acceptor dopants, giving rise to large ionization energies and severely constraining free hole concentrations. Though this hole-trapping behavior affects wurtzite zinc oxide, rocksalt zinc oxide was recently found to be resistant to the formation of hole polarons. Moreover, $p$-type doping using lithium acceptors was predicted to be achievable. While rocksalt zinc oxide is metastable and has a band gap near $\sim$3 eV, here it is found that zinc magnesium oxide (Zn$_{\rm x}$Mg$_{\rm 1-x}$O) alloys remain $p$-type dopable within the stable rocksalt crystal structure, in addition to exhibiting band gaps in excess of 4 eV.

Edge and fog computing have emerged as viable solutions by positioning computing nodes closer to end users, offering lower latency and increased processing power. An edge-fog framework comprises various components, including edge and fog nodes, whose strategic placement is crucial as it directly impacts latency and system cost. This paper presents an effective and tunable node placement strategy based on a genetic algorithm to address the optimization problem of deploying edge and fog nodes. The main objective is to minimize latency and cost through optimal node placement. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves up to 2.77% latency and 31.15% cost reduction.</p>

It has emerged as a prominent approach, particularly in leveraging bit-level sparsity in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, existing bit-serial accelerators exploit bit-level sparsity to reduce computations by skipping zero bits, but they suffer from inefficient memory accesses due to the irregular indices of the non-zero bits. As memory accesses typically are the dominant contributor to DNN accelerator performance, this paper introduces a novel computing approach called bit-column-serial and a compatible architecture design named BitWave.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Beyond hallucinations, another problem in program synthesis using LLMs is ambiguity in user intent. We illustrate the ambiguity problem in a networking context for LLM-based incremental configuration synthesis of route-maps and ACLs. These structures frequently overlap in header space, making the relative priority of actions impossible for the LLM to infer without user interaction. Measurements in a large cloud identify complex ACLs with 100s of overlaps, showing ambiguity is a real problem. We propose a prototype system, Clarify, which uses an LLM augmented with a new module called a Disambiguator that helps elicit user intent. On a small synthetic workload, Clarify incrementally synthesizes routing policies after disambiguation and then verifies them. Our treatment of ambiguities is useful more generally when the intent of updates can be correctly synthesized by LLMs, but their integration is ambiguous and can lead to different global behaviors.</p>

This has spurred a paradigm shift towards new architectures like State Space Models (SSMs) and hybrids, which promise near-linear scaling. While most current research focuses on the accuracy and theoretical throughput of these models, a systematic performance characterization on practical consumer hardware is critically needed to guide system-level optimization and unlock new applications. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive, comparative benchmarking of carefully selected Transformer, SSM, and hybrid models specifically for long-context inference on consumer and embedded GPUs. Our analysis reveals that SSMs are not only viable but superior for this domain, capable of processing sequences up to 2...</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Recent progress has been made in region-aware vision-language modeling, particularly with the emergence of the Describe Anything Model (DAM). DAM is capable of generating detailed descriptions of any specific image areas or objects without the need for additional localized image-text alignment supervision. We hypothesize that such region-level descriptive capability is beneficial for the task of Visual Question Answering (VQA), especially in challenging scenarios involving images with dense text. In such settings, the fine-grained extraction of textual information is crucial to producing correct answers. Motivated by this, we introduce DAM-QA, a framework with a tailored evaluation protocol, developed to investigate and harness the region-aware capabilities from DAM for the text-rich VQA problem that requires reasoning over text-based information within images. DAM-QA incorporates a mechanism that aggregates answers from multiple regional views of image content, enabling more effective...</p>

However, the requirement for robot hardware in the process fundamentally constrains the scale of the data. In this paper, we explore training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using egocentric human videos. The benefit of using human videos is not only for their scale but more importantly for the richness of scenes and tasks. With a VLA trained on human video that predicts human wrist and hand actions, we can perform Inverse Kinematics and retargeting to convert the human actions to robot actions. We fine-tune the model using a few robot manipulation demonstrations to obtain the robot policy, namely EgoVLA. We propose a simulation benchmark called Isaac Humanoid Manipulation Benchmark, where we design diverse bimanual manipulation tasks with demonstrations.

Existing defenses are often reactive, relying on statistical aggregation rules that can be computationally expensive and that typically assume an honest majority. This paper introduces a proactive, economic defense: a lightweight Bayesian incentive mechanism that makes malicious behavior economically irrational. Each training round is modeled as a Bayesian game of incomplete information in which the server, acting as the principal, uses a small, private validation dataset to verify update quality before issuing payments.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Modern deep neural networks are powerful predictive tools yet often lack valid inference for causal parameters, such as treatment effects or entire survival curves. While frameworks like Double Machine Learning (DML) and Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) can debias machine-learning fits, existing neural implementations either rely on targeted losses that do not guarantee solving the efficient influence function equation or computationally expensive post-hoc fluctuations for multi-parameter settings. We propose Targeted Deep Architectures (TDA), a new framework that embeds TMLE directly into the networks parameter space with no restrictions on the backbone architecture. Specifically, TDA partitions model parameters - freezing all but a small targeting subset - and iteratively updates them along a targeting gradient, derived from projecting the influence functions onto the span of the gradients of the loss with respect to weights.

Within this chapter we present a rigorous theoretical introduction to Bayesian inverse problems that includes results on well-posedness and stability in the finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional setting. Afterwards we discuss the use of EBMs for Bayesian inverse problems and explain the most relevant techniques for learning EBMs from data.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Open-weights reasoning language models generate long chains-of-thought (CoTs) before producing a final response, which improves performance but introduces additional alignment risks, with harmful content often appearing in both the CoTs and the final outputs. In this work, we investigate if we can use CoTs to predict final response misalignment. We evaluate a range of monitoring approaches, including humans, highly-capable large language models, and text classifiers, using either CoT text or activations. First, we find that a simple linear probe trained on CoT activations can significantly outperform all text-based methods in predicting whether a final response will be safe or unsafe. CoT texts are often unfaithful and can mislead humans and classifiers, while model latents (i.e., CoT activations) offer a more reliable predictive signal.

Trained to segment breast tissue into three categories (infiltrating tumor, non-neoplastic stroma, and fat), UTS supports clinically relevant tasks such as tumor-stroma quantification and surgical margin assessment.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Aggressive behavior in autistic inpatient youth often arises in temporally clustered bursts complicating efforts to distinguish external triggers from internal escalation. The sample population branching factor-the expected number of new onsets triggered by a given event-is a key summary of self-excitation in behavior dynamics. Prior pooled models overestimate this quantity by ignoring patient-specific variability. We addressed this using a hierarchical Hawkes process with an exponential kernel and edge-effect correction allowing partial pooling across patients.

Existing MoE architectures generally require a fixed amount of computation for a given sample. Our approach, in contrast, yields predictions with increasing accuracy as the computation cycles through the experts sequence. We train our model by iteratively sampling from a set of candidate experts, unfolding the sequence akin to how Recurrent Neural Networks are trained. Our method does not require load-balancing mechanisms, and preliminary experiments show a reduction in training epochs of 10\% to 40\% with a comparable/higher accuracy. These results point to new research directions in the field of MoEs, allowing the design of potentially faster and more expressive models.

This limitation arises because most methods employing contrastive learning-which treats the target image as positive and all other images in the batch as negatives-can inadvertently include false negatives. This may result in retrieving irrelevant images, reducing user satisfaction even when the target image is retrieved. To address this issue, we propose Query-Relevant Retrieval through Hard Negative Sampling (QuRe), which optimizes a reward model objective to reduce false negatives. Additionally, we introduce a hard negative sampling strategy that selects images positioned between two steep drops in relevance scores following the target image, to effectively filter false negatives.

We validate our approach using the KITTI and nuImages datasets, which contain object detection benchmarks for autonomous driving.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> In many critical applications, resource constraints limit the amount of information that can be gathered to make predictions. For example, in healthcare, patient data often spans diverse features ranging from lab tests to imaging studies. Each feature may carry different information and must be acquired at a respective cost of time, money, or risk to the patient. Moreover, temporal prediction tasks, where both instance features and labels evolve over time, introduce additional complexity in deciding when or what information is important. In this work, we propose NOCTA, a Non-Greedy Objective Cost-Tradeoff Acquisition method that sequentially acquires the most informative features at inference time while accounting for both temporal dynamics and acquisition cost. We first introduce a cohesive estimation target for our NOCTA setting, and then develop two complementary estimators: 1) a non-parametric method based on nearest neighbors to guide the acquisition (NOCTA-NP), and 2) a parametri...</p>

While symbolic regression (SR) offers a path to discover such formulas, its performance degrades with high-dimensional inputs and small datasets. We present a two-phase framework that combines neural networks (NN), feature importance analysis, and symbolic regression (SR) to discover interpretable descriptors for OER activity in oxide perovskites. In Phase I, using a small dataset and seven structural features, we reproduce and improve the known {\mu}/t descriptor by engineering composite features and applying symbolic regression, achieving training and validation MAEs of 22.8 and 20.8 meV, respectively. In Phase II, we expand to 164 features, reduce dimensionality, and identify LUMO energy as a key electronic descriptor.

At nanoscale, the computation, communication, sensing, and locomotion capabilities of individual agents are extremely limited, noisy, and/or nonexistent. We present a general model to formally describe the individual and collective behavior of agents in a colloidal environment, such as the bloodstream, for cancer detection and treatment by nanobots. This includes a feasible and precise model of agent locomotion, inspired by actual nanoparticles that, in the presence of an external chemical gradient, move towards areas of higher concentration by means of self-propulsion.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Test-time scaling aims to improve language model performance by leveraging additional compute during inference. While many works have empirically studied techniques like Best-of-N (BoN) and rejection sampling that make use of a verifier to enable test-time scaling, there is little theoretical understanding of how verifier imperfection affects performance. In this work, we address this gap. Specifically, we prove how instance-level accuracy of these methods is precisely characterized by the geometry of the verifiers ROC curve. Interestingly, while scaling is determined by the local geometry of the ROC curve for rejection sampling, it depends on global properties of the ROC curve for BoN. As a consequence when the ROC curve is unknown, it is impossible to extrapolate the performance of rejection sampling based on the low-compute regime. Furthermore, while rejection sampling outperforms BoN for fixed compute, in the infinite-compute limit both methods converge to the same level of accurac...</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Eukaryotic gene regulation is based on stochastic yet controlled promoter switching, during which genes transition between transcriptionally active and inactive states. Despite the molecular complexity of this process, recent studies reveal a surprising invariance of the switching correlation time ($T_C$), which characterizes promoter activity fluctuations, across gene expression levels in diverse genes and organisms. A biophysically plausible explanation for this invariance remains missing. Here, we show that this invariance imposes stringent constraints on minimal yet plausible models of transcriptional regulation, requiring at least four system states and non-equilibrium dynamics that break detailed balance. Using Bayesian inference on Drosophila gap gene expression data, we demonstrate that such models (i) accurately reproduce the observed $T_C$-invariance; (ii) remain robust to parameter perturbations; and (iii) maximize information transmission from transcription factor concentra...</p>

We show that CSRO enhances radiation tolerance by promoting interstitial diffusion while suppressing vacancy migration, thereby increasing defect recombination efficiency during recovery stage. However, CSRO is rapidly degraded under cumulative irradiation, with Warren-Cowley parameters dropping below 0.3 at a dose of only 0.03~dpa. This loss of ordering reduces the long-term enhancement of CSRO on radiation resistance. Our results highlight that while CSRO can effectively improve the radiation tolerance of MoNbTaVW, its stability under irradiation is critical to realizing and sustaining this benefit.</p>

Our approach captures multiscale information and enables permutation-equivariant representations, allowing easy integration into modern transformer-based architectures. Theoretically, the proposed method is maximally expressive because it can distinguish arbitrary non-isomorphic CCs.

Building on this, we train lightweight error detectors that predict model correctness with over 90% accuracy. We then extend our analysis to structured chain-of-thought traces on addition-only GSM8K problems and find that probes trained on simple arithmetic generalize well to this more complex setting, revealing consistent internal representations. Finally, we demonstrate that these probes can guide selective re-prompting of erroneous reasoning steps, improving task accuracy with minimal disruption to correct outputs.

By exploring the full parameter space, we identify the precise conditions under which no-passing is broken, particularly in the regime where a repulsive biquadratic coupling introduces frustration. Here, we find that this violation leaves a clear fingerprint in the form of a discontinuity in the distribution of the field increments between successive avalanches.
