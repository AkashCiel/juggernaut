            <h2>ðŸ¤– AI Summary</h2>
            <p>The recent research papers present a range of advancements across various domains of AI, highlighting both technical innovations and their potential applications. The paper on LiDAR representation learning introduces LiMA, a novel framework that leverages long-term image-to-LiDAR memory aggregation to enhance LiDAR's capability in extracting spatiotemporal information. This approach significantly improves pretraining efficiency and performance in autonomous driving tasks, suggesting a promising direction for reducing reliance on costly annotations while enhancing vehicle perception systems. Similarly, the study on reinforcement learning (RL) for autonomous driving proposes action space reduction strategies to improve training efficiency and policy performance, thus addressing a critical challenge in high-dimensional control environments.

In the realm of image editing, the introduction of X-Planner stands out as it tackles the limitations of existing diffusion-based methods by using a multimodal large language model to better interpret and execute complex, instruction-based edits. This innovation ensures identity preservation and reduces manual intervention, thereby enhancing the usability of image editing tools. Meanwhile, the development of a Spatio-Temporal LLM (ST-LLM) for reasoning about environments and actions marks a significant step in enabling AI models to understand and operate within dynamic real-world contexts, crucial for applications such as robotics and autonomous systems.

Other noteworthy contributions include the SegmentDreamer framework for text-to-3D synthesis, which improves visual quality through Segmented Consistency Trajectory Distillation, and the Open Vision Reasoner, which transfers linguistic cognitive behaviors to enhance visual reasoning capabilities in multimodal models. These advancements underline the increasing convergence of language and vision in AI, aimed at creating more robust and context-aware systems. Additionally, the paper on memory evaluation for LLM agents introduces a new benchmark, MemoryAgentBench, which emphasizes the importance of memory mechanisms in AI design, advocating for ongoing research to enhance the long-term information processing abilities of AI models. Collectively, these studies reflect a broader trend towards developing AI systems that are not only more efficient and capable but also more adaptable and integrated across different modalities and environments.</p>

                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> LiDAR representation learning aims to extract rich structural and semantic information from large-scale, readily available datasets, reducing reliance on costly human annotations. However, existing LiDAR representation strategies often overlook the inherent spatiotemporal cues in LiDAR sequences, limiting their effectiveness. In this work, we propose LiMA, a novel long-term image-to-LiDAR Memory Aggregation framework that explicitly captures longer range temporal correlations to enhance LiDAR representation learning. LiMA comprises three key components: 1) a Cross-View Aggregation module that aligns and fuses overlapping regions across neighboring camera views, constructing a more unified and redundancy-free memory bank; 2) a Long-Term Feature Propagation mechanism that efficiently aligns and integrates multi-frame image features, reinforcing temporal coherence during LiDAR representation learning; and 3) a Cross-Sequence Memory Alignment strategy that enforces consistency across driving sequences, improving generalization to unseen environments. LiMA maintains high pretraining efficiency and incurs no additional computational overhead during downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on mainstream LiDAR-based perception benchmarks demonstrate that LiMA significantly improves both LiDAR semantic segmentation and 3D object detection. We hope this work inspires more effective pretraining paradigms for autonomous driving. The code has be made publicly accessible for future research.</p>

                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Recent diffusion-based image editing methods have significantly advanced text-guided tasks but often struggle to interpret complex, indirect instructions. Moreover, current models frequently suffer from poor identity preservation, unintended edits, or rely heavily on manual masks. To address these challenges, we introduce X-Planner, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based planning system that effectively bridges user intent with editing model capabilities. X-Planner employs chain-of-thought reasoning to systematically decompose complex instructions into simpler, clear sub-instructions. For each sub-instruction, X-Planner automatically generates precise edit types and segmentation masks, eliminating manual intervention and ensuring localized, identity-preserving edits. Additionally, we propose a novel automated pipeline for generating large-scale data to train X-Planner which achieves state-of-the-art results on both existing benchmarks and our newly introduced complex editing benchmark.</p>

                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Despite the significant recent progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), MLLMs still struggle to correctly answer prompts that require a holistic spatio-temporal understanding. Specifically, it is challenging to address prompts that refer to 1) the entirety of an environment that an agent equipped with an MLLM can operate in; and simultaneously also refer to 2) recent actions that just happened and are encoded in a video clip. However, such a holistic spatio-temporal understanding is important for agents operating in the real world. To address this issue, we first develop a framework to collect a large-scale dataset. Using the collected "Reasoning about Environments and Actions" (REA) dataset, we show that recent methods indeed struggle to correctly answer the prompts. To improve, we develop a "spatio-temporal LLM" (ST-LLM), a model equipped with projectors to improve both spatial understanding of an environment and temporal understanding of recent observations. On the collected REA data, we show that the proposed method significantly improves results compared to prior work. Code and data are available at https://zoezheng126.github.io/STLLM-website/.</p>

                <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05257v1" target="_blank">Evaluating Memory in LLM Agents via Incremental Multi-Turn Interactions</a></h3>
                <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuanzhe Hu, Yu Wang, Julian McAuley</p>
                <p><strong>Published:</strong> 7/7/2025</p>
                <p><strong>Categories:</strong> cs.CL, cs.AI</p>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Recent benchmarks for Large Language Model (LLM) agents primarily focus on evaluating reasoning, planning, and execution capabilities, while another critical component-memory, encompassing how agents memorize, update, and retrieve long-term information-is under-evaluated due to the lack of benchmarks. We term agents with memory mechanisms as memory agents. In this paper, we identify four core competencies essential for memory agents: accurate retrieval, test-time learning, long-range understanding, and conflict resolution. Existing datasets either rely on limited context lengths or are tailored for static, long-context settings like book-based QA, which do not reflect the interactive, multi-turn nature of memory agents that incrementally accumulate information. Furthermore, no existing benchmarks cover all four competencies. Therefore, we introduce MemoryAgentBench, a new benchmark specifically designed for memory agents. Our benchmark combines reformulated existing datasets with newly constructed ones, covering the above four memory competencies, providing a systematic and challenging testbed for assessing memory quality. We evaluate a diverse set of memory agents, ranging from simple context-based and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to advanced agents with external memory modules and tool integration. Empirical results reveal that current methods fall short of mastering all four competencies, underscoring the need for further research into comprehensive memory mechanisms for LLM agents.</p>

                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Recent advancements in text-to-3D generation improve the visual quality of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) and its variants by directly connecting Consistency Distillation (CD) to score distillation. However, due to the imbalance between self-consistency and cross-consistency, these CD-based methods inherently suffer from improper conditional guidance, leading to sub-optimal generation results. To address this issue, we present SegmentDreamer, a novel framework designed to fully unleash the potential of consistency models for high-fidelity text-to-3D generation. Specifically, we reformulate SDS through the proposed Segmented Consistency Trajectory Distillation (SCTD), effectively mitigating the imbalance issues by explicitly defining the relationship between self- and cross-consistency. Moreover, SCTD partitions the Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE) trajectory into multiple sub-trajectories and ensures consistency within each segment, which can theoretically provide a significantly tighter upper bound on distillation error. Additionally, we propose a distillation pipeline for a more swift and stable generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SegmentDreamer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality, enabling high-fidelity 3D asset creation through 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS).</p>

                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The remarkable reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) stems from cognitive behaviors that emerge through reinforcement with verifiable rewards. This work investigates how to transfer this principle to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) to unlock advanced visual reasoning. We introduce a two-stage paradigm built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B: a massive linguistic cold-start fine-tuning, followed by multimodal reinforcement learning (RL) spanning nearly 1,000 steps, surpassing all previous open-source efforts in scale. This pioneering work reveals three fundamental insights: 1) Behavior transfer emerges surprisingly early in cold start due to linguistic mental imagery. 2) Cold start broadly memorizes visual behaviors, while RL critically discerns and scales up effective patterns. 3) Transfer strategically favors high-utility behaviors such as visual reflection. Our resulting model, Open-Vision-Reasoner (OVR), achieves state-of-the-art performance on a suite of reasoning benchmarks, including 95.3% on MATH500, 51.8% on MathVision and 54.6% on MathVerse. We release our model, data, and training dynamics to catalyze the development of more capable, behavior-aligned multimodal reasoners.</p>

                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Accurate motion prediction of surrounding traffic participants is crucial for the safe and efficient operation of automated vehicles in dynamic environments. Marginal prediction models commonly forecast each agent's future trajectories independently, often leading to sub-optimal planning decisions for an automated vehicle. In contrast, joint prediction models explicitly account for the interactions between agents, yielding socially and physically consistent predictions on a scene level. However, existing approaches differ not only in their problem formulation but also in the model architectures and implementation details used, making it difficult to compare them. In this work, we systematically investigate different approaches to joint motion prediction, including post-processing of the marginal predictions, explicitly training the model for joint predictions, and framing the problem as a generative task. We evaluate each approach in terms of prediction accuracy, multi-modality, and inference efficiency, offering a comprehensive analysis of the strengths and limitations of each approach. Several prediction examples are available at https://frommarginaltojointpred.github.io/.</p>

                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising framework for autonomous driving by enabling agents to learn control policies through interaction with environments. However, large and high-dimensional action spaces often used to support fine-grained control can impede training efficiency and increase exploration costs. In this study, we introduce and evaluate two novel structured action space modification strategies for RL in autonomous driving: dynamic masking and relative action space reduction. These approaches are systematically compared against fixed reduction schemes and full action space baselines to assess their impact on policy learning and performance. Our framework leverages a multimodal Proximal Policy Optimization agent that processes both semantic image sequences and scalar vehicle states. The proposed dynamic and relative strategies incorporate real-time action masking based on context and state transitions, preserving action consistency while eliminating invalid or suboptimal choices. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse driving routes, we show that action space reduction significantly improves training stability and policy performance. The dynamic and relative schemes, in particular, achieve a favorable balance between learning speed, control precision, and generalization. These findings highlight the importance of context-aware action space design for scalable and reliable RL in autonomous driving tasks.</p>

                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> We describe the physical characteristics of interstellar comet 3I\ATLAS, discovered on 2025 July 1 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System. The comet has eccentricity, $e$ $\simeq$ 6.08 and velocity at infinity, v$_{\infty}$ $\simeq$ 57 km/s, indicating an interstellar origin. We obtained g, r, i photometry with the Palomar 200-inch Next Generation Palomar Spectrograph on 2025 July 3. We measured colour indices g-r = 0.43$\pm$0.02 mag, r-i = 0.16$\pm$0.02 mag, and g-i = 0.59$\pm$0.03 mag and a spectral slope of 1.3$\pm$0.9 $\%$/100 nm. We calculate the dust cross-section within 10,000 km of the comet to be 230.0$\pm$5.2 km$^2$, assuming an albedo of 0.10. The FWHM of 3I\ATLAS's detection is $\sim$2.2 arcsec as measured in our r-band images and has A(0$^\circ$)f$\rho$ of 287.2$\pm$2.8 cm. Finally, we use the sunward extent of the coma to constrain the dust ejection speed, finding that \textmu m-scale to mm-scale particles have $\sim$0.01-1 m/s, implying the comet's dust mass-loss rate is $\sim$0.1 - 1.0 kg/s.</p>

                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in galaxy mergers with separations $<$ 1kpc are crucial to our understanding of SMBH growth, galaxy evolution, and the evolution of SMBH binaries. Despite their importance, there are less than a handful known, and most have been discovered serendipitously. In this work, we employ a new selection method to systematically pre-select candidate advanced mergers likely to contain unresolved substructure at sub-arcsecond scales. By exploiting the large survey area and astrometric precision of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we have identified a sample of 48 nearby advanced mergers that have red WISE colors ($W_1-W_2>0.5$) indicative of accretion activity and significant sub-arcsecond offsets between their optical and infrared coordinates as measured by SDSS and WISE. We conducted high resolution adaptive optics (AO) observations of this sample with the Keck NIRC2 camera in the $K_p$ band ($2.124 ~ \mu m$, $\Delta\lambda = 0.351 \mu m$) to search for evidence of previously unresolved substructure suggested by the optical-to-infared offsets. We find that a significant fraction (20/48 or 42%) of the sample shows substructure tracing the SDSS/WISE offset and unresolved by SDSS, demonstrating that our methodology is a promising pathway to find dual AGN in follow-up spectroscopy. Archival optical Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging reveals that substructure identified with Keck is often missed in the optical or erroneously identified due to partial obscuration, underscoring the importance of carrying out studies of late-stage mergers in the infrared.</p>
