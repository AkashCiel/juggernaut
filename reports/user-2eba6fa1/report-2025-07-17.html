                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> We study the realization of $\mathsf{C}$, $\mathsf{P}$, $\mathsf{T}$ in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM - corresponding to charge conjugation, parity, and time-reversal - and identify the $\mathsf{C}$, $\mathsf{P}$, $\mathsf{T}$ global symmetries of ${\cal N}=4$ SYM with bulk (gauge) symmetries of string theory on $AdS_5\times S^5$. The dual bulk transformations are symmetries of Type IIB string theory on $AdS_5\times S^5$ that combine string worldsheet symmetries, with geometric transformations acting on $AdS_5\times S^5$. We show that $\mathsf P$ and $\mathsf T$ map to $\mathsf{CP}$ and $\mathsf{CT}$ under $S$-duality (combined with an $SU(4)$ R-symmetry outer automorphism), while $\mathsf C$ and $ \mathsf{CPT}$ are invariant. We also define a chiral, codimension-two surface defect in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM associated with charge conjugation, and provide its bulk $AdS_5\times S^5$ dual gravitational description.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Every data selection method inherently has a target. In practice, these targets often emerge implicitly through benchmark-driven iteration: researchers develop selection strategies, train models, measure benchmark performance, then refine accordingly. This raises a natural question: what happens when we make this optimization explicit? To explore this, we propose benchmark-targeted ranking (BETR), a simple method that selects pretraining documents based on similarity to benchmark training examples. BETR embeds benchmark examples and a sample of pretraining documents in a shared space, scores this sample by similarity to benchmarks, then trains a lightweight classifier to predict these scores for the full corpus. We compare data selection methods by training over 500 models spanning $10^{19}$ to $10^{22}$ FLOPs and fitting scaling laws to them. From this, we find that simply aligning pretraining data to evaluation benchmarks using BETR achieves a 2.1x compute multiplier over DCLM-Baseli...</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> 3D modeling is moving from virtual to physical. Existing 3D generation primarily emphasizes geometries and textures while neglecting physical-grounded modeling. Consequently, despite the rapid development of 3D generative models, the synthesized 3D assets often overlook rich and important physical properties, hampering their real-world application in physical domains like simulation and embodied AI. As an initial attempt to address this challenge, we propose \textbf{PhysX}, an end-to-end paradigm for physical-grounded 3D asset generation. 1) To bridge the critical gap in physics-annotated 3D datasets, we present PhysXNet - the first physics-grounded 3D dataset systematically annotated across five foundational dimensions: absolute scale, material, affordance, kinematics, and function description. In particular, we devise a scalable human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline based on vision-language models, which enables efficient creation of physics-first assets from raw 3D assets.2) Further...</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) emerged as a promising tool for mechanistic interpretability of transformer-based foundation models. Very recently, SAEs were also adopted for the visual domain, enabling the discovery of visual concepts and their patch-wise attribution to tokens in the transformer model. While a growing number of foundation models emerged for medical imaging, tools for explaining their inferences are still lacking. In this work, we show the applicability of SAEs for hematology. We propose CytoSAE, a sparse autoencoder which is trained on over 40,000 peripheral blood single-cell images. CytoSAE generalizes to diverse and out-of-domain datasets, including bone marrow cytology, where it identifies morphologically relevant concepts which we validated with medical experts. Furthermore, we demonstrate scenarios in which CytoSAE can generate patient-specific and disease-specific concepts, enabling the detection of pathognomonic cells and localized cellular abnormalities at the patc...</p>

Although recent progress has explored various aspects of human behavior$\unicode{x2014}$such as motion, trajectories, and intention$\unicode{x2014}$a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating human behavior understanding in autonomous driving remains unavailable.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> We present SpatialTrackerV2, a feed-forward 3D point tracking method for monocular videos. Going beyond modular pipelines built on off-the-shelf components for 3D tracking, our approach unifies the intrinsic connections between point tracking, monocular depth, and camera pose estimation into a high-performing and feedforward 3D point tracker. It decomposes world-space 3D motion into scene geometry, camera ego-motion, and pixel-wise object motion, with a fully differentiable and end-to-end architecture, allowing scalable training across a wide range of datasets, including synthetic sequences, posed RGB-D videos, and unlabeled in-the-wild footage. By learning geometry and motion jointly from such heterogeneous data, SpatialTrackerV2 outperforms existing 3D tracking methods by 30%, and matches the accuracy of leading dynamic 3D reconstruction approaches while running 50$\times$ faster.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Radiologists rely on eye movements to navigate and interpret medical images. A trained radiologist possesses knowledge about the potential diseases that may be present in the images and, when searching, follows a mental checklist to locate them using their gaze. This is a key observation, yet existing models fail to capture the underlying intent behind each fixation. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning-based approach, RadGazeIntent, designed to model this behavior: having an intention to find something and actively searching for it. Our transformer-based architecture processes both the temporal and spatial dimensions of gaze data, transforming fine-grained fixation features into coarse, meaningful representations of diagnostic intent to interpret radiologists goals. To capture the nuances of radiologists varied intention-driven behaviors, we process existing medical eye-tracking datasets to create three intention-labeled subsets: RadSeq (Systematic Sequential Search), RadExplor...</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> K\uhn and Osthus conjectured in 2013 that regular tripartite tournaments are decomposable into Hamilton cycles. Somewhat surprisingly, Granet gave a simple counterexample to this conjecture almost 10 years later. In this paper, we show that the conjecture of K\uhn and Osthus nevertheless holds in an approximate sense, by proving that every regular tripartite tournament admits an approximate decomposition into Hamilton cycles. We also study Hamilton cycle packings of directed graphs in the same regime, and show that for large $n$, every balanced tripartite digraph on $3n$ vertices which is $d$-regular for $d\ge (1+o(1))n$ admits a Hamilton decomposition.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The scalar spectral index $n_s$ is a powerful test of inflationary models. The tightest constraint on $n_s$ to date derives from the combination of cosmic microwave background (CMB) data with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data. The resulting $n_s$ constraint is shifted significantly upward relative to the constraint from CMB alone, with the consequence that previously preferred inflationary models are seemingly disfavored by $\gtrsim 2 \sigma$. Here we show that this shift in $n_s$ is the combined effect of a degeneracy between $n_s$ and BAO parameters exhibited by CMB data and the tension between CMB datasets and DESI BAO data under the assumption of the standard cosmological model. Given the crucial role of $n_s$ in discriminating between inflationary models, we urge caution in interpreting CMB+BAO constraints on $n_s$ until the BAO-CMB tension is resolved.</p>

Inspired by this result and the work of Bloch, Esnault, and Kerz, we define the infinitesimal motivic complexes, and then show a relative Chern character isomorphism with integral coefficients in a range. This has a direct consequence on infinitesimal deformations in algebraic $K$-theory, which is related to the $p$-adic variational Hodge conjecture.</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator or Lasso, introduced by Tibshirani (1996), is one of the widely used regularization methods in regression. It is observed that the properties of Lasso vary wildly depending on the choice of the penalty parameter. The recent results of Lahiri (2021) suggest that, depending on the nature of the penalty parameter, Lasso can either be variable selection consistent or be $n^{1/2}-$consistent. However, practitioners generally implement Lasso by choosing the penalty parameter in a data-dependent way, the most popular being the $K$-fold cross-validation. In this paper, we explore the variable selection consistency and $n^{1/2}-$consistency of Lasso when the penalty is chosen based on $K$-fold cross-validation with $K$ being fixed. We consider the fixed-dimensional heteroscedastic linear regression model and show that Lasso with $K$-fold cross-validation based penalty is $n^{1/2}-$consistent, but not variable selection consistent.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> One-shot signatures (OSS) were defined by Amos, Georgiou, Kiayias, and Zhandry (STOC20). These allow for signing exactly one message, after which the signing key self-destructs, preventing a second message from ever being signed. While such an object is impossible classically, Amos et al observe that OSS may be possible using quantum signing keys by leveraging the no-cloning principle. OSS has since become an important conceptual tool with many applications in decentralized settings and for quantum cryptography with classical communication. OSS are also closely related to separations between classical-binding and collapse-binding for post-quantum hashing and commitments. Unfortunately, the only known OSS construction due to Amos et al. was only justified in a classical oracle model, and moreover their justification was ultimately found to contain a fatal bug. Thus, the existence of OSS, even in a classical idealized model, has remained open. We give the first standard-model OSS, with p...</p>

While several adaptive stopping rules have been proposed, in the cost-aware setting they lack guarantees ensuring they stop before incurring excessive function evaluation costs. We propose a cost-aware stopping rule for Bayesian optimization that adapts to varying evaluation costs and is free of heuristic tuning. Our rule is grounded in a theoretical connection to state-of-the-art cost-aware acquisition functions, namely the Pandoras Box Gittins Index (PBGI) and log expected improvement per cost. We prove a theoretical guarantee bounding the expected cumulative evaluation cost incurred by our stopping rule when paired with these two acquisition functions.

Advances in silicon photonic electro-optic modulators and wavelength selective components have enabled the utilization of wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) in integrated optical transceivers, offering a high data-rate operation while achieving enhanced energy efficiency, bandwidth density, scalability, and the reach required for data-centers. Here, we report the demonstration of a single chip optical WDM PAM4 receiver, where by co-integration of a 32-channel optical demultiplexer (O-DeMux) with autonomous wavelength tuning and locking at a near-zero power consumption and a 32-channel ultra-low power concurrent electrical detection system, a record chip energy efficiency of under 0.38 pJ/bit is measured. The implemented 32 channel monolithic WDM optical receiver chip achieves an end-to-end latency of under 100 ps and a bit-error-rate of less than 10-12 with no equalization, pre-distortion, or digita...</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Modeling latent representations in a hyperspherical space has proven effective for capturing directional similarities in high-dimensional text data, benefiting topic modeling. Variational autoencoder-based neural topic models (VAE-NTMs) commonly adopt the von Mises-Fisher prior to encode hyperspherical structure. However, VAE-NTMs often suffer from posterior collapse, where the KL divergence term in the objective function highly diminishes, leading to ineffective latent representations. To mitigate this issue while modeling hyperspherical structure in the latent space, we propose the Spherical Sliced Wasserstein Autoencoder for Topic Modeling (S2WTM). S2WTM employs a prior distribution supported on the unit hypersphere and leverages the Spherical Sliced-Wasserstein distance to align the aggregated posterior distribution with the prior. Experimental results demonstrate that S2WTM outperforms state-of-the-art topic models, generating more coherent and diverse topics while improving perfo...</p>

Accurate perception and motion planning are crucial to enabling vehicles to navigate complex environments while avoiding collisions. In this paper, we propose an efficient obstacle avoidance pipeline that leverages a camera-only perception module and a Frenet-Pure Pursuit-based planning strategy.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Exchange-only (EO) qubits, implemented in triple-quantum-dot systems, offer a compelling platform for scalable semiconductor-based quantum computing by enabling universal control through purely exchange interactions. While high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gates have been demonstrated, the synthesis of efficient multi-qubit operations -- such as the Toffoli gate -- remains a key bottleneck. Conventional gate decompositions into elementary operations lead to prohibitively long and error-prone pulse sequences, limiting practical deployment. In this work, we introduce a gradient-based optimization algorithm, Jenga-Krotov (JK), tailored to discover compact, high-fidelity EO gate sequences. Applying JK to the Toffoli gate, we reduce the number of required exchange unitaries from 216 (in standard decomposition) to 92, and compress the time steps required from 162 to 50, all while maintaining target fidelity.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> In statistical decision theory, the choice of loss function fundamentally shapes which estimators qualify as optimal. This paper introduces and develops the general concept of exclusivity classes of loss functions: subsets of loss functions such that no estimator can be optimal (according to a specified notion) for losses lying in different classes. We focus on the case of minmax optimality and define minmax exclusivity classes, demonstrating that the classical family of power-type loss functions $L_p(\theta,a) = |\theta - a|^p$ forms such a class. Under standard regularity and smoothness assumptions, we prove that no estimator can be simultaneously minmax for losses belonging to two distinct $L_p$ classes. This result is obtained via a perturbation argument relying on differentiability of risk functionals and the conic structure of loss spaces. We formalize the framework of exclusivity partitions, distinguishing trivial and realizable structures, and analyze their algebraic properties...</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Nearly all ultrawide-bandgap oxides are affected by hole localization that limits $p$-type conductivity and thus potential applications for these materials. Highly localized holes, also known as hole polarons, trap in the vicinity of acceptor dopants, giving rise to large ionization energies and severely constraining free hole concentrations. Though this hole-trapping behavior affects wurtzite zinc oxide, rocksalt zinc oxide was recently found to be resistant to the formation of hole polarons. Moreover, $p$-type doping using lithium acceptors was predicted to be achievable. While rocksalt zinc oxide is metastable and has a band gap near $\sim$3 eV, here it is found that zinc magnesium oxide (Zn$_{\rm x}$Mg$_{\rm 1-x}$O) alloys remain $p$-type dopable within the stable rocksalt crystal structure, in addition to exhibiting band gaps in excess of 4 eV.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Reducing latency in the Internet of Things (IoT) is a critical concern. While cloud computing facilitates communication, it falls short of meeting real-time requirements reliably. Edge and fog computing have emerged as viable solutions by positioning computing nodes closer to end users, offering lower latency and increased processing power. An edge-fog framework comprises various components, including edge and fog nodes, whose strategic placement is crucial as it directly impacts latency and system cost. This paper presents an effective and tunable node placement strategy based on a genetic algorithm to address the optimization problem of deploying edge and fog nodes. The main objective is to minimize latency and cost through optimal node placement. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves up to 2.77% latency and 31.15% cost reduction.</p>

However, existing bit-serial accelerators exploit bit-level sparsity to reduce computations by skipping zero bits, but they suffer from inefficient memory accesses due to the irregular indices of the non-zero bits. As memory accesses typically are the dominant contributor to DNN accelerator performance, this paper introduces a novel computing approach called bit-column-serial and a compatible architecture design named BitWave.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Beyond hallucinations, another problem in program synthesis using LLMs is ambiguity in user intent. We illustrate the ambiguity problem in a networking context for LLM-based incremental configuration synthesis of route-maps and ACLs. These structures frequently overlap in header space, making the relative priority of actions impossible for the LLM to infer without user interaction. Measurements in a large cloud identify complex ACLs with 100s of overlaps, showing ambiguity is a real problem. We propose a prototype system, Clarify, which uses an LLM augmented with a new module called a Disambiguator that helps elicit user intent. On a small synthetic workload, Clarify incrementally synthesizes routing policies after disambiguation and then verifies them. Our treatment of ambiguities is useful more generally when the intent of updates can be correctly synthesized by LLMs, but their integration is ambiguous and can lead to different global behaviors.</p>

This has spurred a paradigm shift towards new architectures like State Space Models (SSMs) and hybrids, which promise near-linear scaling. While most current research focuses on the accuracy and theoretical throughput of these models, a systematic performance characterization on practical consumer hardware is critically needed to guide system-level optimization and unlock new applications.

Our numerical evidence indicates that the proposed algorithm achieves the Heisenberg limit in both strongly and weakly correlated regimes and requires very short evolution times to obtain an $\epsilon$-accurate estimate of multiple eigenvalues at once. Additionally -- and of independent interest -- we develop a modified off-grid protocol that leverages prior knowledge of the underlying signal for faster and more accurate recovery.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> We have recently presented the multichannel Dyson equation as an alternative to the standard single-channel Dyson equation. While the latter involves a single many-body Greens function, the former uses a multichannel Greens function in which two or more many-body Greens functions are coupled. Quasiparticles and satellites are thus naturally treated on equal footing in the multichannel Dyson equation. To assess the accuracy of our approach we apply it here to the ground- and excited-state properties of the extended Hubbard dimer, an exactly solvable model for $H_2$. In particular, we focus on the potential energy surface as well as the corresponding spectral functions and HOMO-LUMO gaps, which are well-known challenges for many-body approximations such as second Born and $GW$.

While frameworks like Double Machine Learning (DML) and Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) can debias machine-learning fits, existing neural implementations either rely on targeted losses that do not guarantee solving the efficient influence function equation or computationally expensive post-hoc fluctuations for multi-parameter settings. We propose Targeted Deep Architectures (TDA), a new framework that embeds TMLE directly into the networks parameter space with no restrictions on the backbone architecture. Specifically, TDA partitions model parameters - freezing all but a small targeting subset - and iteratively updates them along a targeting gradient, derived from projecting the influence functions onto the span of the gradients of the loss with respect to weights. This procedure yields plug-in estimates that ...</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Accurate pedestrian intention estimation is crucial for the safe navigation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and hence attracts a lot of research attention. However, current models often fail to adequately consider dynamic traffic signals and contextual scene information, which are critical for real-world applications. This paper presents a Traffic-Aware Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (TA-STGCN) that integrates traffic signs and their states (Red, Yellow, Green) into pedestrian intention prediction. Our approach introduces the integration of dynamic traffic signal states and bounding box size as key features, allowing the model to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies in complex urban environments. The model surpasses existing methods in accuracy. Specifically, TA-STGCN achieves a 4.75% higher accuracy compared to the baseline model on the PIE dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving pedestrian intention prediction.</p>

EBMs are probability distributions modeled via Gibbs densities $p(x) \propto \exp{-E(x)}$ with an appropriate energy functional $E$. Within this chapter we present a rigorous theoretical introduction to Bayesian inverse problems that includes results on well-posedness and stability in the finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional setting. Afterwards we discuss the use of EBMs for Bayesian inverse problems and explain the most relevant techniques for learning EBMs from data. As a crucial part of Bayesian inverse problems, we cover several popular algorithms for sampling from EBMs, namely the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, Gibbs sampling, Langevin Monte Carlo, and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Moreover, we present numerical results for the resolution of several inverse imaging problems obtained by leveraging an EBM that allows for the explicit verification of t...</p>

Although the corresponding band structure modifications below the CDW transition temperature are well established, only a few reports discuss the occurrence of the CDW fluctuating phase and its spectral features well above the transition temperature. Here, we report the direct observation of spectral features associated with CDW fluctuations at 295 K, using time-resolved extreme ultraviolet momentum microscopy. We investigated the transient melting and recovery of CDW fluctuations upon nonresonant ultrafast photoexcitation.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Two-dimensional planar ion crystals in a Penning trap are a platform for quantum information science experiments. However, the low-frequency planar modes of these crystals are not efficiently cooled by laser cooling, which can limit the utility of the drumhead modes for quantum information processing. Recently, it has been shown that nonlinear mode coupling can enhance the cooling of the low-frequency planar modes. Here, we demonstrate in numerical simulations that this coupling can be dynamically tuned by adiabatically changing the rotation frequency of the ion crystal during experiments. Furthermore, we show that this technique can, in addition, produce lower temperatures for the low-frequency planar modes via an adiabatic cooling process. This result allows cooling of the planar modes to sub-millikelvin temperatures, resulting in improved spectral resolution of the drumhead modes at experimentally relevant rotation frequencies, which is crucial for quantum information processing app...</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Open-weights reasoning language models generate long chains-of-thought (CoTs) before producing a final response, which improves performance but introduces additional alignment risks, with harmful content often appearing in both the CoTs and the final outputs. In this work, we investigate if we can use CoTs to predict final response misalignment. We evaluate a range of monitoring approaches, including humans, highly-capable large language models, and text classifiers, using either CoT text or activations. First, we find that a simple linear probe trained on CoT activations can significantly outperform all text-based methods in predicting whether a final response will be safe or unsafe. CoT texts are often unfaithful and can mislead humans and classifiers, while model latents (i.e., CoT activations) offer a more reliable predictive signal.

This approach reduces annotation effort and improves computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. To implement this approach, we introduce a Multi-Level Vision Transformer (L-ViT), which benefits the multi-level feature representation to capture both fine-grained morphology and global tissue context. Trained to segment breast tissue into three categories (infiltrating tumor, non-neoplastic stroma, and fat), UTS supports clinically relevant tasks such as tumor-stroma quantification and surgical margin assessment.

While 3D CNNs have been effective at capturing spatiotemporal dynamics, recent Transformer models leverage self-attention to model long-range spatial and temporal dependencies. Despite achieving state-of-the-art performance on major benchmarks, Transformers remain computationally expensive, particularly with dense video data. To address this, we propose a lightweight Video Focal Modulation Network, DVFL-Net, which distills spatiotemporal knowledge from a large pre-trained teacher into a compact nano student model, enabling efficient on-device deployment. DVFL-Net utilizes knowledge distillation and spatial-temporal feature modulation to significantly reduce computation while preserving high recognition performance.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Aggressive behavior in autistic inpatient youth often arises in temporally clustered bursts complicating efforts to distinguish external triggers from internal escalation. The sample population branching factor-the expected number of new onsets triggered by a given event-is a key summary of self-excitation in behavior dynamics. Prior pooled models overestimate this quantity by ignoring patient-specific variability. We addressed this using a hierarchical Hawkes process with an exponential kernel and edge-effect correction allowing partial pooling across patients. This approach reduces bias from high-frequency individuals and stabilizes estimates for those with sparse data. Bayesian inference was performed using the No U-Turn Sampler with model evaluation via convergence diagnostics, power-scaling sensitivity analysis, and multiple Goodness-of-Fit (GOF) metrics: PSIS-LOO the Lewis test with Durbins modification and residual analysis based on the Random Time Change Theorem (RTCT).

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Bounding box regression (BBR) is fundamental to object detection, where the regression loss is crucial for accurate localization. Existing IoU-based losses often incorporate handcrafted geometric penalties to address IoUs non-differentiability in non-overlapping cases and enhance BBR performance. However, these penalties are sensitive to box shape, size, and distribution, often leading to suboptimal optimization for small objects and undesired behaviors such as bounding box enlargement due to misalignment with the IoU objective. To address these limitations, we propose InterpIoU, a novel loss function that replaces handcrafted geometric penalties with a term based on the IoU between interpolated boxes and the target. By using interpolated boxes to bridge the gap between predictions and ground truth, InterpIoU provides meaningful gradients in non-overlapping cases and inherently avoids the box enlargement issue caused by misaligned penalties.

Existing MoE architectures generally require a fixed amount of computation for a given sample. Our approach, in contrast, yields predictions with increasing accuracy as the computation cycles through the experts sequence. We train our model by iteratively sampling from a set of candidate experts, unfolding the sequence akin to how Recurrent Neural Networks are trained. Our method does not require load-balancing mechanisms, and preliminary experiments show a reduction in training epochs of 10\% to 40\% with a comparable/higher accuracy. These results point to new research directions in the field of MoEs, allowing the design of potentially faster and more expressive models.
