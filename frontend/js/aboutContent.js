    philosophy: `In the modern world, information and news is extremely cheap and abundant. This creates an information overload upon people that exhausts them without giving them the high quality information that they need. I built this product to solve this problem. People can talk to the app and determine themselves what do they see in their news feed. This app will never seek investment or sponsorship, thus ensuring that only the users have all the say in the design and functionality of this app. Ultimately, this app is an attempt to help the user navigate the current information ecosystem with a greater ease.`
